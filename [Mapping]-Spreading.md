#Spreading

In this section we will explain about the employment in our concept. Please be prepared your self as we are going deeper and deeper. 

_Here we do our best to explain as you might get confused. However, in order to get easier on following this section we recommend you to make clear yourself to our [[previous section|[Mapping]-Routines]]._
##Basic
Let's put again all of _[[the mappings|Mapping#our-concept]]_ here:

Mapping of the change to your routine process:
```
* Looking for your best food will become an entry point
* An information of best food is what we need 
* Looking is the process
* Exit point  
```
Mapping of the process to collect the library in related with the food:
```
* Food will become an entry point
* Library is what we need 
* Collect is the process
* Exit point  
```
Then we need also the mapping to examine your self to get your data:
```
* You will become an entry point
* Your data is what we need 
* Examine is the process
* Exit point  
```
Let's map about the process of getting the best food for you the same way as your doctor do:
```
* Both of food library and your data will become the entry point
* A best food on library for you is what we need 
* Matching the data is the process
* Exit point  
```

##Behaviour
Now we are going to explain the behaviour of a mapping when a parameter is putting inside.
Let's take mapping of _Figure 4_ as the routines one.  
![hyipworld flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure4.png)  
Let put again the mapping here.
```  
* Hungry will become an entry point
* Food is what we need 
* Eat is the process
* Exit point  
```
Take a look at the process. Eat is the process. Consider it as a routine process. What is going on when you want to find a best to eat but you don't know yet which one is.

Of course you remain eat whatever the food you have on hand. Since you insist to get one so you will have to do something to get it.

So here for sure your routine will not be the same again. You have to do another effort out of your routines. Another effort means another process. In our concept another process means another mapping. In this project another mapping means another repository.

##Mitosis
In our normal live this kind of process can be identical with when a cell is separated into two (2) identical sets, people call this process as a _[[mitosis|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitosis]]_.

Here the process is look like:  

![mitosos](https://tophyipmonitor.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/mitosis.jpg)  

The process mitosis of a cell to become two (2) identical sets is consist of four (4) step. In our concept the final result will also produce two (2) identical sets. 

In our case these two (2) identical sets will consist of two (2) identical mapping of the process of eating a food which are:
 
* one mapping is remain eating _your original food_
* another mapping is eating _your best food_

As we have explained in the _[[settlement|Mapping#settlement]]_ about the behavior of this concept, whenever two (2) identical process is founded then the system will call for a comparation.

This comparation process will let the one which giving a better result to take the position as the part of the main process. 

The one which is not taken in the position will keep remain stay but no more carry out. It will stay as a reference or a back-up.

Consider is a sense way. When you have already know what your best food is then for sure you have to choose whether you remain back to your original routines or change your routines to the new process. _You cannot carry out both process all together in the same time_.

We are going to explain further how a mapping will become two (2). Like _[[the mitosis|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitosis]]_, the process in our concept will also consist of four (4) steps which we call them as _spreading, employment, merging and settlement_. 

Let't start to find them in more details one by one.

#Spreading
Based on the concept of mapping then a new process shall follow these basic rules:
* Have one assigned main process and one assigned displaying process
* The title of the process shall be different with the routines
  
Let's take again the mapping of the routines    
![hyipworld flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure4.png)   
As we have explained, on the basic concept of mapping, you can put whatever word you like to name a new process.
   
So simply make it a copy of the routines, put another word to replace the word of `info`, let's take the word of `world` then. So now you have two mapping with a different process. One for your routines and another one for the new process.

Now left the question on how to combine them, right? Here are the rules:  
* The new process shall be able to be carried out along with the routines
* It shall be a clearly sign that a new process is being carried out of the routines

So when applying this all together then the diagram will be shown as below:  
![hyipworld flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure5.png)

You can see that this mapping has four (4) processes, just exactly like when we count the number of elements inside a routines.

In our concept we call this kind of mapping as an _employment._ The method of getting an employment from its routines we call it as a _spreading_. 

Until this point the diagram for an employment is completed.
