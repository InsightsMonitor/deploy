#Spreading

Here we will explain about _a spreading_ in our concept. A process of factoring _[[a routine|[Mapping]-Routines]]_ due to a parameter. Please be prepared your self as we are going deeper ongoing forward.

_Here we do our best to explain as you might get confused. However, in order to get easier on following this section we recommend you to make clear yourself to our [[previous section|[Mapping]-Routines]]._
##Basic
Let's put again all of _[[the mappings|Mapping#our-concept]]_ here:

Mapping of the change to your routine process:
```
* Looking for your best food will become an entry point
* An information of best food is what we need 
* Looking is the process
* Exit point  
```
Mapping of the process to collect the library in related with the food:
```
* Food will become an entry point
* Library is what we need 
* Collect is the process
* Exit point  
```
Then we need also the mapping to examine your self to get your data:
```
* You will become an entry point
* Your data is what we need 
* Examine is the process
* Exit point  
```
Let's map about the process of getting the best food for you the same way as your doctor do:
```
* Both of food library and your data will become the entry point
* A best food on library for you is what we need 
* Matching the data is the process
* Exit point  
```

##Diagram  
We are going to explain further what going on with a basic diagram when we are putting a parameter into of a routine process. 
###Rules
Based on the concept of mapping then a new process shall follow these basic rules:
* Have one assigned main process and one assigned displaying process
* The title of the process shall be different with the routines

Let's take again the mapping of the routines    
![hyipworld flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure4.png)   
As we have explained, on the basic concept of mapping, you can put whatever word you like to name a new process.
   
So simply make it a copy of the routines, put another word to replace the word of `info`, let's take the word of `world` then. So now you have two mapping with a different process. One for your routines and another one for the new process.
###Combine
Now left the question on how to combine them, right? Here are the rules:  
* The new process shall be able to be carried out along with the routines
* It shall be a clearly sign that a new process is being carried out of the routines

So when applying this all together then the diagram will be shown as below:  
![hyipworld flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure5.png)

You can see that this mapping has four (4) processes, just exactly like when we count the number of elements inside a routines.

Until this point the diagram for _a spreading_ is completed.

##Content Flow
Then the content flow for the 1st Employment can be tabulated as below:
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>type</th>
      <th>flow</th>
      <th>repo</th>
      <th>info</th>
      <th>flow</th>
      <th>world</th>
      <th>flow</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td scope="row">query</td>
      <td scope="row">:arrow_right:</td>
      <td scope="row">main</td>
      <td scope="row">
        <ul>
          <li>task: <i>write</i></li>
          <li>target: <i>Query</i></li>
        </ul>
      </td>
      <td scope="row">:arrow_lower_right:</td>
      <td scope="row">
        <ul>
          <li>task: <i>write</i></li>
          <li>target: <strong><i>Library</i></strong></li>
        </ul>
      </td>
      <td scope="row">:arrow_left:</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td scope="row">result</td>
      <td scope="row">:arrow_left:</td>
      <td scope="row">hyip</td>
      <td scope="row">
        <ul>
          <li>task: <strong><i>read</i></strong></li>
          <li>object: <strong><i>Library</i></strong></li>
        </ul>
      </td>
      <td scope="row">:arrow_lower_left:</td>
      <td scope="row">
        <ul>
          <li>task: <strong><i>read</i></strong></li>
          <li>object: <i>Query</i></li>
        </ul>
      </td>
      <td scope="row">:arrow_heading_up:</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

#What's Next
From that point you may see that a basic diagram will turn its behavior and seeking a way to return to its routine by calling another mappings which is in our concept we call them as _Employment_ and _Merging_. 
##Employment
Employment is a mapping built automatically whenever a parameter is assigned to a routines. In our concept there will be two kind of employments will be called. Each of Those 2 kind of employments is present the following:

Mapping of the process to collect the library in related with the food:
```
* Food will become an entry point
* Library is what we need 
* Collect is the process
* Exit point  
```
Then we need also the mapping to examine yourself to get your data:
```
* You will become an entry point
* Your data is what we need 
* Examine is the process
* Exit point  
```
See that one mapping is doing a process making a library which is concern to collect data in related to the parameter. Another is doing a process to examine to the one who is going to use it in related also to the parameter. 

So both will be a different process but they work in related to the same parameter.
##Merging
As you may guess this merging is the process of matching both of the employments.

Let's map about the process of getting the best food for you the same way as your doctor do:
```
* Both of food library and your data will become the entry point
* A best food on library for you is what we need 
* Matching the data is the process
* Exit point  
```
We will explain to how to do the both in a different section, let start first on _[[Employment|[Mapping]-Employment]]_.
