#Routines

We have explained the [[background of our concept|Mapping]]. Now we will explain the mapping of this project. Please be prepared your self as we are going deeper ongoing forward.

_Here we do our best to explain as you might get confused. However, in order to get easier on following this section we recommend you to make clear yourself to our [[previous section|Mapping]]._
##Basic
Let's put again all of _[[the mappings|Mapping#our-concept]]_ here:

Mapping of the change to your routine process:
```
* Looking for your best food will become an entry point
* An information of best food is what we need 
* Looking is the process
* Exit point  
```
Mapping of the process to collect the library in related with the food:
```
* Food will become an entry point
* Library is what we need 
* Collect is the process
* Exit point  
```
Then we need also the mapping to examine your self to get your data:
```
* You will become an entry point
* Your data is what we need 
* Examine is the process
* Exit point  
```
Let's map about the process of getting the best food for you the same way as your doctor do:
```
* Both of food library and your data will become the entry point
* A best food on library for you is what we need 
* Matching the data is the process
* Exit point  
```
Here on this section, we will explain about our way on making the mapping using layout diagram. We are going to get it applicable for all the above mappings.
##Symbol
See that all of the mappings are consist of 4 elements which function in all of mappings are the same. So we can define a symbolization for each of elements. Let's take this way:
```
1. A straight line for entry point
2. A text to define what we need
4. A box to indicate the process 
2. A Dotted line for exit point
``` 
![hyipworld flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure1.png)  
The diagram as shown in _Figure 1_ has 4 elements. Each represent each element inside the mapping. We just need to put _what we need_ as a text above the box. 

Let's take a look into each mapping one by one. You may find that in our case this text can be each of the followings:
* `Food`
* `Library`
* `Your Data`
* `A best food on library for you`  
  
To identify each of them, here we simply put the word `info` above the box. Basically it can be any word you want. Let's take this word to continue further.

##Identification
The further step is we are going to identify the process inside the box. This will become a repository. We shall better provide it with a documentation to describe the process. 

So let's put a repo and a wiki inside the box.  
![hyipworld flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure2.png)  
##Navigation  
As we are going to make a flow system on this project then in order to have a clear navigation we need to define a flowing diagram between the repo and the wiki. Let's put it this way:  
![hyipworld flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure3.png)
##Displaying
We will need also to display the process to the web. Here we make a separation between the flowing of the process to become able to be displayed. 

We also need to give a different title of on it to be easily defined. So just simply make the same diagram but add another word to the process of this displaying. Here we put our project name `hyip` as our choice on the displaying process.   

Here is now the diagram will look like:  
![hyipworld flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure4.png)  

You can see that this mapping has four (4) elements, consist of two (2) repos and two (2) wikis. Just like the number of elements inside a routines.
```
* Hungry will become an entry point
* Food is what we need 
* Eat is the process
* Exit point  
```

Until this point the diagram for a mapping is completed.

#What's Next
We are going to explain further what going on with a basic diagram when we are putting a parameter into of a routine process. 

From that point you may see that a basic diagram will turn its behavior and seeking a way to return to its routine by calling another mappings which is in our concept we call them as _Employment_ and _Merging_. 
##Employment
Employment is a mapping built automatically whenever a parameter is assigned to a routines. In our concept there will be two kind of employments will be called. Each of Those 2 kind of employments is present the following:

Mapping of the process to collect the library in related with the food:
```
* Food will become an entry point
* Library is what we need 
* Collect is the process
* Exit point  
```
Then we need also the mapping to examine yourself to get your data:
```
* You will become an entry point
* Your data is what we need 
* Examine is the process
* Exit point  
```
See that one mapping is doing a process making a library which is concern to collect data in related to the parameter. Another is doing a process to examine to the one who is going to use it in related also to the parameter. 

So both will be a different process but they work in related to the same parameter.
##Merging
As you may guess this merging is the process of matching both of the employments.

Let's map about the process of getting the best food for you the same way as your doctor do:
```
* Both of food library and your data will become the entry point
* A best food on library for you is what we need 
* Matching the data is the process
* Exit point  
```
We will explain to how to do the both in a different section, let start first on _[[Employment|[Mapping]-Spreading]]_.
