#Overall
This page is the last page of our _[[Mapping Concept|Mapping]]_. Here we are going to explain on how we manage our repositories of this project follow to the overall concept.  

_Here we do our best to explain as you might get confused. However, in order to get easier on following this section we recommend you to make clear yourself to our [[previous section|Mapping-Comparison]]._

##Repositories
Hopefully you can follow and enable to understand to what we have explained. Now we are going to explain what we are going to do with this concept in our project.

You can consider that the diagram as shown above stand as our basic diagram of a mapping. This diagram is presenting when a process is assigned to do a routine task.

###User, organization, and project
To make clear separation to the process here we take a new repo and wiki for the displaying purpose. Based on the documentatin about _<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/#building-your-user--organization-pages" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a>_ we recommend to use User Repository for the main process, and take the Organization for displaying purpose.

* The process of `info` will stand as User Repository
* The Process of `hyip info` will stand as Organization Repository

###Forked Repository
![hyipworld flow](https://tophyipmonitor.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/map_4.png)   
* The Process of `hyip info` be displayed as Organization Pages
* The process of `info` will be displayed as Project Pages  

Follow to the diagram, all the code of main process will be put on User. Out of those main processes such of code will be arranged so it can be displayed on Organization and described on their correspond wikis. 
###Appearance
Here is the appearance of repositories will look like:

##Displaying
You can consider that the diagram as shown above stand as our basic diagram of a mapping. This diagram is presenting when a process is assigned to do a routine task.
###Employments
We shall do the displaying for three (3) employments of four (4) repositories each. Each will need to be arranged as below:
![hyipworld flow](https://tophyipmonitor.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/map_5.png)   
We are going to make the displaying between six (6) Users and six (6) Organizations. 
###1st Employment

###2nd Employment

###3rd Employment

##Interaction
###Overall
Interaction between repositories shall need to be arranged in four (4) groups of interaction follow to this diagram.

###Matching

#What's Next  
Youâ€™ve reached the end part of the Documentation Section of Mapping on our project. Hopefully you can follow and enable to understand to what we have explained.  

It might be on your question now about what really the content of each repos and wikis are. Well they will be a quite similar with what we have described on this section.

As you are aware this section is about a process of what we called as `info`. We collect, create and write on the code to proceed all aspect into the repo in related to its part on the concept, and explain it in the same configuration into the topics arrangement of its wiki. 

You may find that we started this wiki with the concept on how we are going to read an info, how we write the info, following with on how we manage and organize it till a kind of mapping system on the last chapter of the section that you are reading now.

You will find that the same thing are done also to other sections but provided in a different topic and purposes as they have their own assignment on the system follow to the concept.
 
Please take a look to the appearance of all the processes on our _[[Project Map|maps]]_.
