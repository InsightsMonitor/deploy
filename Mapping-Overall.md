#Overall
This page is the last page of our _[[Mapping Concept|Mapping]]_. Here we are going to explain on how we manage our repositories of this project follow to the overall concept.  

_Here we do our best to explain as you might get confused. However, in order to get easier on following this section we recommend you to make clear yourself to our [[previous section|Mapping-Comparison]]._

##Basic
Let's put again all of the mappings here:
###Routine
Mapping of _[[a routine|Mapping#Routine]]_
```  
* Hungry will become an entry point
* Food is what we need 
* Eat is the process
* Exit point  
```
###Parameter
Mappings by _[[a parameter|Mapping#parameter]]_  

Mapping of the change to your routine process:
```
* Looking for your best food will become an entry point
* An information of best food is what we need 
* Looking is the process
* Exit point  
```
Mapping of the process to collect the library in related with the food:
```
* Food will become an entry point
* Library is what we need 
* Collect is the process
* Exit point  
```
Then we need also the mapping to examine your self to get your data:
```
* You will become an entry point
* Your data is what we need 
* Examine is the process
* Exit point  
```
Let's map about the process of getting the best food for you the same way as your doctor do:
```
* Both of food library and your data will become the entry point
* A best food on library for you is what we need 
* Matching the data is the process
* Exit point  
```

#Assignment
Hopefully you can follow and enable to understand to what we have explained. Now we are going to explain what we are going to do with this concept in our project.

##Repositories
You can consider that the diagram as shown above stand as our basic diagram of a mapping. This diagram is presenting when a process is assigned to do a routine task.

###User, organization, and project
To make clear separation to the process here we take a new repo and wiki for the displaying purpose. Based on the documentatin about _<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/#building-your-user--organization-pages" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a>_ we recommend to use User Repository for the main process, and take the Organization for displaying purpose.

* The process of `info` will stand as User Repository
* The Process of `hyip info` will stand as Organization Repository

###Forked Repository
![hyipworld flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure4.png)   
* The Process of `hyip info` be displayed as Organization Pages
* The process of `info` will be displayed as Project Pages  

Follow to the diagram, all the code of main process will be put on User. Out of those main processes such of code will be arranged so it can be displayed on Organization and described on their correspond wikis. 
###Appearance
Here is the appearance of repositories will look like:

##Displaying
You can consider that the diagram as shown above stand as our basic diagram of a mapping. This diagram is presenting when a process is assigned to do a routine task.
###Employments
We shall do the displaying for three (3) employments of four (4) repositories each. Each will need to be arranged as below:
![hyipworld flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure5.png)   
We are going to make the displaying between six (6) Users and six (6) Organizations. 
###1st Employment
![hyipworld flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure6.png)   
###2nd Employment
![hyipworld flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure8.png)   
###3rd Employment
![hyipworld flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure9.png)   

##Interaction
###Overall
Interaction between repositories shall need to be arranged in four (4) groups of interaction follow to this diagram.  
![hyipworld flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure16.png)  
###Matching
![hyipworld flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure5.png)  
###Routine

#What's Next  
You have come to the end of our concept. Hopefully you can follow and enable to understand to what we have explained.  

It might be on your question now about what really the content of each repos and wikis are. Well they will be a quite similar with what we have described on this section.

As you are aware this section is about a process of what we called as `info`. So we collect, create and write on the code to proceed all aspect in related to its part on the concept into the repo and explain it in the same configuration into the arrangement of the topic in this wiki. 

You may find that we started this wiki with the concept on how we are going to read an info, how we write the info, following with on how we manage and organize it till a kind of mapping system on the last chapter of the section that you are reading now.

You will find that the same thing are done also to other sections but provided in a different topic and purposes as they have their own assignment on the system follow to the concept.
 
Please take a look to the appearance of all the processes on our _[[Project Map|maps]]_.
