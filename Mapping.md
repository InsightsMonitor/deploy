#Mapping
##Background
Here you come to our section that we gonna explain our concept in detail about our project.

As we have named this project as 'The HYIP Project' then we would like you to visit a page [*here*](https://tophyipmonitor.wordpress.com/hyip-world/) that describe in general of what we want to achieve.

As we have mentioned in our project description, we intent to be among the best and trusted company in scoring any business in the same way as how people see Google on giving their amazing service on ‘keyword base’ search result to the world.

To achieve on what we have planned there shall be a process involved. Every process from an input to became the output will need an entry and exit points

To make it more clear, let take an example on our daily live. We have to take an example that definitely has an entry and exit points. 

An easy case is when we are hungry so that we need a food to eat. If we don't eat *the hungry* will not became and end point, it is stack there. You can see easily find that this process will need to be settled in order to continue our living. 

Consider our living is the global process. If you don't eat then it will jeopardize the global process. So this particular process need to be settled and it will end when take a food to eat. So then global process is run normally.

Here we make a mapping of the process from the *the hungry*:

* Hungry will became an entry point
* Food is what we need 
* Eat is the process
* Exit point  

This process is a simple case. It will become more concern if we put a parameter. Say you are hungry. You want the best food to eat. What we need to do? 

Let go searching then. Try to put a keyword 'best food' on Google Search. You will find a huge result which is processed by Google from may be in million or billion pages to choose. So which one you gonna eat?

##isogram
An isogram is a word that doesn't contain any repeating letters.    
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isogram

The JavaScript tracking tag for Google's new Universal Analytics uses one letter variable names - i, s, o, g, r, a, m.
The Google JavaScript Snippet [Advanced Configuration - Web Tracking (analytics.js)](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/advanced)

```js
(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){
(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),
m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)
})(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');
