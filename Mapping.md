#Mapping
Here you come to our section that we gonna explain our concept in detail about our project.
##Background

As we have named this project as 'The HYIP Project' then we would like you to visit a page [*here*](https://tophyipmonitor.wordpress.com/hyip-world/) that describe in general of what we want to achieve.

To achieve on what we have planned there shall be a process involved. Every process from an input to became the output will need an entry and exit points

To make it more clear, let take an example on our daily live. We have to take an example that definitely has an entry and exit points. 

An easy case is when we are hungry so that we need a food to eat. If we don't eat *the hungry* will not became an end point, it is stack there. You can see easily find that this process will need to be settled in order to continue our living. 

Consider our living is the global process. If you don't eat then it will jeopardize the global process. So this particular process need to be settled and it will end when take a food to eat. So then global process is run normally.

Here we make a mapping of the process from the *the hungry*:

```
* Hungry will became an entry point
* Food is what we need 
* Eat is the process
* Exit point  
```

This is just a simple case. It is a normal process in you live. It is a routine. It will become to your concern if we put a parameter. Say you are hungry. You want to have the best food to eat but you don't know yet which one. What are you going to do? 

Let's go searching then. Try to put a keyword _<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=best+food" target="_blank">'best food'</a>_ on Google Search. You will find a huge result which is processed by Google from may be more than a billion pages to choose. So which one you gonna eat? The top result? Are you sure if that is the best food for you?
##How to find it?
We can say that from what we have explained above, there is a little chance you find your best food from the result. One thing you should aware that Google and other search engines is concern with the page not the food.

When the page has a good scoring in term of their algorithm then the food page will go up on their result so you can easily find it. 

It might be some where a page made by someone that contain really your best food but only has poor score on the page they are presented, so chance is little for you to find it. The worst case is it might be there is no page about it so you can't find it anywhere. 

Another thing that you will need to concern is how to be sure that when you find an information about your best food is really your best food. Here chance is also little. None of search engine can guarantee that their result is really the answer to your need. 

_It could even never ever happen on your whole live that you find your best food!_

So here you can't get it, but you really need to get it. Let say you better go to a doctor to know what is the best food for you. Would you define what is your doctor going to do? 

Of course he will first check what do you want. Once he is agree with you then he will do examine your self and find the food on his library that match to your data. Here the important think is that he will define base on what he got from your data, not the food that you want.

It is really different with what if you are going to get the food by your self, you will find the food with the food you want, _not the food that match to your data_. 

So here the best way you shall do is take the food that the _doctor want_ you to eat. Not the food that _you think_ it is the best one for you.

In an extreme case it will be the same. Say you are a very important person. You are the president of a country. The country will for sure provide you a team of the best doctors in the country. They will do their best to find and recommend the best food for you.

So here, because you are the president, it is not only the doctors but the country or may be the world also want you to eat the food base on the recommendation from the doctors. _Not the food that match to what you think it is the best one for you._

`Just do the way they want. Not of what you think.`

##What we offer
We have to sorted out all information in related to the food. We also need all of your data. Then we can define your best food.  

Getting the data of the food is one process. Getting the data of you is also another process. Both are different.

Let's define how we are going to get the data in related with the food in the same way as we make a mapping of the process from the *the hungry*. Let's put again the mapping here:
```
* Hungry will became an entry point
* Food is what we need 
* Eat is the process
* Exit point  
```
Mapping of the process on getting the data in related with the food:
```
* Hungry will became an entry point
* Food is what we need 
* Eat is the process
* Exit point  
```
Then we need also the mapping about your self:
```
* Hungry will became an entry point
* Food is what we need 
* Eat is the process
* Exit point  
```
See that each of the process has a different assignment, none of them is meaningless, each of them hold a unique task, nothing is repeated. 
 
#What's Next
As we have mentioned in our project description, we intent to be among the best and trusted company in scoring any business in the same way as how people see Google on giving their amazing service on ‘keyword base’ search result to the world.

##How to put the parameter?
Most probably we can say that Google Still World's Most Popular Search Engine By Far. Why is Google successful?  As usual, Let's try _<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=what+makes+google+the+best+search+engine" target="_blank">searching</a>_ again.

Here are what we got. We put here just for example:
* <a href="http://www.googleguide.com/searchLeader.html" target="_blank">Why is Google Popular?</a>
* <a href="http://www.todayszaman.com/blog/mustafa-gerdan/why-is-google-successful_337734.html" target="_blank">Why is Google successful?</a>
* <a href="http://www.answers.com/Q/Why_is_Google_the_best_search_engine" target="_blank">Why is Google the best search engine</a> 
* <a href="http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/224639" target="_blank">Bing vs. Google: Which Search Engine is Best?</a>
* <a href="http://searchengineland.com/google-worlds-most-popular-search-engine-148089" target="_blank">Google Still World's Most Popular Search Engine By Far</a>
* <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/accurate-contrarian-theories-2011-5" target="_blank">Why Google Succeeded Where Other Search Engines Failed</a>

Here you can see that there are a number of reasons or parameters that people say to describe how Google become the best search engine.

It is quite amazing because usually when people put different criteria then the result can be different, let take an example, say what is the best food now in the world? Every one can give different answer base on their parameter or criteria. 

But when people asked what is the best search engine, then mostly probably you will find that Google is the answer whatever criteria they use. 

_How come that people have a different criteria but they got the same answer._

Are you with us? We would think so. But it sound unfair.. Why?  
Because you have already the answer to your best search engine easily.  
How about your best food? Do you have already find one? 

This is the real world.

`Let them find their way to help you get what you want.`

##Nonpattern Word (isogram)
Having make a research on what people has do a similar with the concept, we found this on _[[isogram|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isogram]]_ which is a word that doesn't contain any repeating letters.  The word of `isogram` it self is a good sample. You will not find any repeating on it. So all of them is unique.

Luckily we found also that Google has made a single function using this word, this function is used worldwide since many years on their JavaScript Snippet called <a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/advanced" target="_blank">Advanced Configuration - Web Tracking (analytics.js)</a>.

`The JavaScript tracking tag for Google's new Universal Analytics uses one letter variable names - i, s, o, g, r, a, m.`

Here is the function look likes:
```js
(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){
(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),
m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)
})(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');
```

We can breakdown the assignment on each letter as below
```js
letter i stand as window  
letter s stand as document  
letter o stand as 'script'  
letter g stand as '//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js'  
letter r stand as 'ga'  
letter a stand as s.createElement(o)  
letter m stand as s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0]  
```

See that each letter has a different assignment, each of them hold a unique task. None of them is meaningless. All is important especially when they are getting combined. 

We found this as a beautiful concept. It's built small as it use only a few characters but it is really compact which enable Google to use it for a broadway _<a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/sending-hits" target="_blank">utilization</a>_. 

Unfortunately we could not find if Google made it with the word of `isogram` is in a purpose to correlate what _the word means_ it self into _what they want_ with the function. 

Nevertheless, this is really an exact sample that close enough with what we will explain further in more details on the next section titled _[[Mapping the Concept|[Mapping]-Concept]]_.
