= Employment =
In this section we will explain about ''an employment'' in our concept. The generated symbiotic processes from ''[[Mapping-Spreading|a spreading]]'' as a further step of factoring ''[[Mapping-Routine|a routine]]'' due to a parameter. 

''Here we do our best to explain as you might get confused. However, in order to get easier on following this section we recommend you to make clear yourself to our [[Mapping-Spreading|previous section]]''.
== Basic ==
Let's put again all of the mappings here:
We have explained that the behavior of our mapping will seeking another process to return to its routine by taking the process of spreading. 

Here we will explain further how the spreading will continue to another process when a settlement is not going to be achieved. We will also explain how these processes are going to present the above 2nd and 3rd mapping.
=== Rules ===
A process is considered as settled whenever it can be run or return to the entry point and processed normally without any adjustment or modification into the Routine.

For instance, let say you have eat the food, then you got that it is not suit to your need. Means it is not the best one for you. So you need to do the searching again at which the process back to the entry point again.   

== 1st Employment ==
Let's put again the diagram we have got on ''[[Mapping-Spreading|previous section]]''<br /> 
[[<img src="https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure5.png">]] 

As you may see, every process will be a different. All is unique.<br /> 
[[<img src="https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure6.png">]]  

=== Content Flow ===
Then the content flow for the ''1st Employment'' can be tabulated as below:

  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>type</th>
      <th>flow</th>
      <th>repo</th>

So in line to what he have explained about ''[[Mapping#nonpattern-word-isogram|isogram]]'' here you can see the breakdown of the assigned letters as below: 
```js
letter a stand as info  
letter b stand as world  
letter c stand as hyip  
```
So we can now put the mapping schema into a standardization as shown below: <br /> 
[[<img src="https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure7.png">]]<br />  
=== Monitoring ===
To became a valuable info then we need to rate the data and became a library. The info it self is got from searching and investigation which in the business is known as monitoring or in a short: ''<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/monitor" target="_blank">monitor</a>''.  
* Someone who watches over something; a person in charge of something or someone.
* A device that detects and informs on the presence, quantity, etc., of something.
On our case we use this monitoring by means of a one who admonishes; one who warns of faults, informs of duty, or gives advice and instruction by way of reproof or caution and capable of being revolved so as to bring the several tools successively into position.

We wonder if these nets don’t have anything mathematical in them. 

''<a href="http://austega.com/florin/CharmOfGeometry.htm" target="_blank">This page</a>'' is explaining  that the answer is positive, and is incredible how an insect with few thousands of neurons know this mathematics. 

Look at the following figure and try to solve spider’s problem.

The most interesting fact is that spiders create their nets making inscriptible quadrilaterals. So A’ABB’ is inscriptible, and all the others are the same. Prove that if ABCDEFGHIJ is a polygon with all its vertexes on the same circle, than A’B’C’D’E’F’G’H’I’J’ has all vertexes also on the same circle. The trick is simple, you need first to prove that OA·OA’=OB·PB’=OC·OC’ etc.

In fact we have here another transformation, “the inversion”. In this case this transformation transform a circle into a different circle. The inversion can transform a circle into a line if the point O (the center of inversion) is on the circle (see the figure). 

In this case the circle determined by OABCDE is transformed in a line A’B’C’D’E’F’
It seems that this transformation creates another interesting instrument for geometry. First we have to notice that OAB and OA’B’ are similar triangle, but with '''inverse similarity'''. This means that we can ‘t obtain one from the second one by magnifying and rotating it. So the angle OAB equals the angle OB’A’.

=== Rating ===
A ''<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rating" target="_blank">rating</a>'' is the evaluation or assessment of something, in terms of quality (as with a critic rating a novel), quantity (as with an athlete being rated by his or her statistics), or some combination of both. 

''<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/rating" target="_blank">Rating</a>'' can be means also:
* A position on a scale
* An evaluation of status, especially of financial status
* A number, letter, or other mark that refers to the ability of something.
On our case we use this rating by means of a ''<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reputation_system" target="_blank">reputation system</a>'', a score for a set of objects within the community based on a collection of opinions.

The perfect hexagonal shape of honeycomb cells — once thought to be an incredible feat of math-savvy insects — has now been explained by simple mechanics.

Scientists have marveled at the angular perfection of honeycomb for centuries, but none have been able to clearly describe how it forms. Engineers in the U.K. and China have taken a step forward by showing that the cells actually start off as circles — molded by the shape of a bee's body — and then flow into a hexagonal pattern seconds later. The researchers reported their findings on July 16 in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface.

They saw that after dancing for a while, a scout bee would take a break to walk around the swarm. She would then deliver a stop signal to another dancing bee, but only if that bee had checked out the '''opposite nest'''. "It turns out that they are quite discriminating," Seeley said. "That's pretty sophisticated."

== 3rd Employment ==
As a symbiotic relationship with the 2nd employment so the 3rd employment is simply produce ''a query'' in such a way that it will give ''a result'' when it is implemented to the library.  

On the 2nd employment, ''<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monitoring" target="_blank">Monitoring</a>'' is process to gain the data, ''Rating'' is process of sorting the data to become a library. 

Here we need a language so that a library will understand what ''a query'' is. People call this language as ''<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL" target="_blank">SQL</a>'' stand as the abbreviation of ''Structured Query Language''.

=== Script ===
When we see the explanation of what ''SQL'' is, it contain of statement that structured as a code to do a process on a Library. So it is actually a scripting language.

Let's call it from here as ''<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/script" target="_blank">a script</a>'' then.<br />

So how ''a script'' can be produced? How to get it to become able to be implemented?

=== Team ===
In our concept the ''Rating'' shall do the same language with the ''Script'' on managing the data. So here the ''Script'' again has become a symbiotic relationship with the ''Rating''.

So now, it is left only what kind of process that become a symbiotic relationship with the ''Monitoring'', right?

As we have mentioned above, ''Monitoring'' generally means to be aware of the state of a system, to observe a situation for any changes. You can also found in more details about definition of the ''Monitoring'' on the ''<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/monitoring">Wiktionary</a>''.

Question is how to carry out this kind of process, no other way we have to built a group of people involved in the same activity to carry them all together.

Let's make a little test in a cross way in related to the symbiotic relation
* The 2nd Employment produce ''a library'' - the 3rd Employment produce ''a query''
* On 2nd Employment: ''Monitoring'' collect entry data - ''Rating'' convert to ''the library''  
* On 3rd Employment: ''Team'' collect data on exit point - ''Script'' convert to ''the query'' 
* ''Script'' is the language of ''Rating'' activity - ''Monitoring'' is the language of ''Team''  activity

Seems everything are correct. So ''<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/team" target="_blank">a team</a>'' is supposed to be the one !
Here we will will show the details of the ''3rd Employment'' by ''diagram'', ''sequence'' and ''tabulation''.
=== By Diagram ===
```js
letter a stand as script  
letter b stand as team  
letter c stand as hyip  
```
Then diagram will be shown as below:<br />

Until this point our section for the employment is completed.
= What's Next =
Combining all together we have now 3 kind of Employments which are:  
 
''1. [[Mapping-Employment#1st-employment|Info & World]]: info - world'' <br /> 
''2. [[Mapping-Employment#2nd-employment|Monitor & Rating]]: monitor - rating'' <br /> 
''3. [[Mapping-Employment#3rd-employment|Script & Team]]: script - team''  

== The Three ==
Employment can be all kind of process that you want. In our concept we just need ''three (3) of employments''. One for Routine, and the other two for the process in related to the parameter.

You may see that each kind of these ''three (3) of employments'' has four (4) processes, becoming twelve (12)  processes all together.
== The Last One ==
We have pronounced since the beginning that all the mappings has always got ''four (4) parts''. 

Either mapping for ''[[Mapping-Routine|a routine]]'', diagram for ''[[Mapping-Spreading|a spreading]]'', also for an employment. All of them got always ''four (4) parts'' So why we only take ''three (3) of employments''. Not four (4)? 

Actually there is ''The Fourth (4th)''. Stand as ''The Last Employment''. Very special. The key of all this concept. So let's stop the employments until this point. 

We are going to bring you to ''[[Mapping-Merging|The Fourth]]''.
