= Employment =
In this section we will explain about ''an employment'' in our concept. The generated symbiotic processes from ''[[Mapping-Spreading|a spreading]]'' as a further step of factoring ''[[Mapping-Routine|a routine]]'' due to a parameter. 

''Here we do our best to explain as you might get confused. However, in order to get easier on following this section we recommend you to make clear yourself to our [[Mapping-Spreading|previous section]]''.
== Basic ==
Let's put again all of the mappings here:
We have explained that the behavior of our mapping will seeking another process to return to its routine by taking the process of spreading. 

Here we will explain further how the spreading will continue to another process when a settlement is not going to be achieved. We will also explain how these processes are going to present the above 2nd and 3rd mapping.
  
=== Rules ===
A process is considered as settled whenever it can be run or return to the entry point and processed normally without any adjustment or modification into the Routine.

For instance, let say you have eat the food, then you got that it is not suit to your need. Means it is not the best one for you. So you need to do the searching again at which the process back to the entry point again.   

== 1st Employment ==
Let's put again the diagram we have got on ''[[Mapping-Spreading|previous section]]''<br /> 
[[<img src="https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure5.png">]] 

As you may see, every process will be a different. All is unique.<br /> 
[[<img src="https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure6.png">]]  

=== Content Flow ===
Then the content flow for the ''1st Employment'' can be tabulated as below:
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>type</th>
      <th>flow</th>
      <th>repo</th>
      <th>info</th>
      <th>flow</th>
      <th>world</th>
      <th>flow</th>
    </tr>

      </td>
      <td scope="row">:arrow_lower_left:</td>
      <td scope="row">

      </td>
      <td scope="row">:arrow_heading_up:</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

== 2nd Employment ==
So in line to what he have explained about ''[[Mapping#nonpattern-word-isogram|isogram]]'' here you can see the breakdown of the assigned letters as below: 
```js
letter a stand as info  
letter b stand as world  
letter c stand as hyip  
```
So we can now put the mapping schema into a standardization as shown below: <br /> 
[[<img src="https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure7.png">]]<br />  
=== Monitoring ===
To became a valuable info then we need to rate the data and became a library. The info it self is got from searching and investigation which in the business is known as monitoring or in a short: ''<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/monitor" target="_blank">monitor</a>''.  
* Someone who watches over something; a person in charge of something or someone.
* A device that detects and informs on the presence, quantity, etc., of something.
* One who admonishes; one who warns of faults, informs of duty, or gives advice and instruction by way of reproof or caution.

=== Rating ===
''<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/rating" target="_blank">Rating</a>'' 
* A position on a scale
* An evaluation of status, especially of financial status
* A number, letter, or other mark that refers to the ability of something.

== 3rd Employment ==
As a symbiotic relationship with the 2nd employment so the 3rd employment is simply produce ''a query'' in such a way that it will give ''a result'' when it is implemented to the library.  

On the 2nd employment, ''<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monitoring" target="_blank">Monitoring</a>'' is process to gain the data, ''Rating'' is process of sorting the data to become a library. 

=== By Titling ===
Here we need a language so that a library will understand what ''a query'' is. People call this language as ''<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL" target="_blank">SQL</a>'' stand as the abbreviation of ''Structured Query Language''.

''' Script '''
When we see the explanation of what ''SQL'' is, it contain of statement that structured as a code to do a process on a Library. So it is actually a scripting language.

Let's call it from here as ''<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/script" target="_blank">a script</a>'' then.<br />

So how ''a script'' can be produced? How to get it to become able to be implemented?

''' Team '''
In our concept the ''Rating'' shall do the same language with the ''Script'' on managing the data. So here the ''Script'' again has become a symbiotic relationship with the ''Rating''.

So now, it is left only what kind of process that become a symbiotic relationship with the ''Monitoring'', right?

As we have mentioned above, ''Monitoring'' generally means to be aware of the state of a system, to observe a situation for any changes. You can also found in more details about definition of the ''Monitoring'' on the ''<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/monitoring">Wiktionary</a>''.

Question is how to carry out this kind of process, no other way we have to built a group of people involved in the same activity to carry them all together.

Let's make a little test in a cross way in related to the symbiotic relation
* The 2nd Employment produce ''a library'' - the 3rd Employment produce ''a query''
* On 2nd Employment: ''Monitoring'' collect entry data - ''Rating'' convert to ''the library''  
* On 3rd Employment: ''Team'' collect data on exit point - ''Script'' convert to ''the query'' 
* ''Script'' is the language of ''Rating'' activity - ''Monitoring'' is the language of ''Team''  activity

Seems everything are correct. So ''<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/team" target="_blank">a team</a>'' is supposed to be the one !
Here we will will show the details of the ''3rd Employment'' by ''diagram'', ''sequence'' and ''tabulation''.
=== By Diagram ===
```js
letter a stand as script  
letter b stand as team  
letter c stand as hyip  
```
Then diagram will be shown as below:<br />  
[[<img src="https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure9.png">]]
=== By Content Flow ===
Then the content flow for the _3rd Employment_ can be tabulated as below:
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>type</th>
      <th>flow</th>
      <th>repo</th>
      <th>script</th>

      <td scope="row">:arrow_heading_up:</td>

Until this point our section for the employment is completed.
= What's Next =
Combining all together we have now 3 kind of Employments which are:  
 
''1. [[Mapping-Employment#1st-employment|Info & World]]: info - world'' <br /> 
''2. [[Mapping-Employment#2nd-employment|Monitor & Rating]]: monitor - rating'' <br /> 
''3. [[Mapping-Employment#3rd-employment|Script & Team]]: script - team''  

== The Three ==

Employment can be all kind of process that you want. In our concept we just need ''three (3) of employments''. One for Routine, and the other two for the process in related to the parameter.

You may see that each kind of these ''three (3) of employments'' has four (4) processes, becoming twelve (12)  processes all together.
== The Last One ==
We have pronounced since the beginning that all the mappings has always got ''four (4) parts''. 

Either mapping for ''[[Mapping-Routine|a routine]]'', diagram for ''[[Mapping-Spreading|a spreading]]'', also for an employment. All of them got always ''four (4) parts'' So why we only take ''three (3) of employments''. Not four (4)? 

Actually there is ''The Fourth (4th)''. Stand as ''The Last Employment''. Very special. The key of all this concept. So let's stop the employments until this point. 

We are going to bring you to ''[[Mapping-Merging|The Fourth]]''.
