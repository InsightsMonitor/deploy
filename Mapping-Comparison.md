#Comparison

In this section we will explain in details about _a comparison_ in our concept. The called process whenever _two (2) or more identical sets_ of _[[a routine|Mapping-Routine]]_ are founded.

_Here we do our best to explain as you might get confused. However, in order to get easier on following this section we recommend you to make clear yourself to our [[previous section|Mapping-Settlement]]._
##Basic
Let's put again all of the mappings here:
###Routine
Mapping of _[[a routine|Mapping#Routine]]_
```  
* Hungry will become an entry point
* Food is what we need 
* Eat is the process
* Exit point  
```
###Parameter
Mappings by _[[a parameter|Mapping#parameter]]_  

Mapping of the change to your routine process:
```
* Looking for your best food will become an entry point
* An information of best food is what we need 
* Looking is the process
* Exit point  
```
Mapping of the process to collect the library in related with the food:
```
* Food will become an entry point
* Library is what we need 
* Collect is the process
* Exit point  
```
Then we need also the mapping to examine your self to get your data:
```
* You will become an entry point
* Your data is what we need 
* Examine is the process
* Exit point  
```
Let's map about the process of getting the best food for you the same way as your doctor do:
```
* Both of food library and your data will become the entry point
* A best food on library for you is what we need 
* Matching the data is the process
* Exit point  
```
Let's clean the mapping that we get on the last result, now we can get it as shown below:  
![Flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure16.png)  
This is the result of the employment of _The Fourth_. The same as other mappings, this result has also four (4) parts, each of them are separated by a line.

##Rules
One thing you shall note about spreading is that our concept is work only with a new unique process. Whenever it found the same identical process than the one which is already take a place will do its own spreading and open a new place for the said process.

On the next step the spreading will take the comparison process which will let the one that has a better result to take the place on the main process. This kind of spreading will remain the whole system to stay on its behavior as a unique process.

Please check the appearance of the comparison process in our concept:

###Overall Diagram
![Flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure16.png)  
Four (4) parts.

###Matching Diagram
![hyipworld flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure5.png)  
Four (4) processes.  

###Settlement Diagram
![hyipworld flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure4.png)  
Four (4) repositories.  

###Routine Diagram
![hyipworld flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure1.png)  
Four (4) elements.  

Until this point the process of _a comparison_ is completed.

#What's Next
As we have explained since the beginning, in our concept whenever _[[a spreading|Mapping-Spreading]]_ is happen then the process will go to find the way to go back to its routine.

You may see that from the _[[merging|Mapping-Merging]]_ by  _[[a settlement|Mapping-Settlement]]_ it will be back to the _[[employment|Mapping-Employment]]_, and by _[[a comparison|Mapping-Comparison]]_ it will back to the _[[spreading|Mapping-Spreading]]_.

So in this concept you may see the correlation between each process, it is a kind of one-to-one mapping between the processes like we have explained about the _[[`isogram`|Mapping#isogram]]_. 

We left only now to explain about the last process called _[[an overall|Mapping-Overall]]_ which will let the whole system back to the _[[routine|Mapping-Routine]]_ and making all the processes to become final and settled.

We are going to bring you to the _[[overall|Mapping-Overall]]_.
