#Routines

We have explained the [[background of our concept|Mapping]]. Now we will explain the mapping of this project. We will start to explain about _a routine_. The basic mapping on our concept.

_Here we do our best to explain as you might get confused. However, in order to get easier on following this section we recommend you to make clear yourself to our [[previous section|Mapping]]._
##Basic
Let's put again all of the mappings here:
###Routine
Mapping of _[[a routine|Mapping#routines]]_
```  
* Hungry will become an entry point
* Food is what we need 
* Eat is the process
* Exit point  
```
###Parameter
Mappings by _[[a parameter|Mapping#parameter]]_  

Mapping of the change to your routine process:
```
* Looking for your best food will become an entry point
* An information of best food is what we need 
* Looking is the process
* Exit point  
```
Mapping of the process to collect the library in related with the food:
```
* Food will become an entry point
* Library is what we need 
* Collect is the process
* Exit point  
```
Then we need also the mapping to examine your self to get your data:
```
* You will become an entry point
* Your data is what we need 
* Examine is the process
* Exit point  
```
Let's map about the process of getting the best food for you the same way as your doctor do:
```
* Both of food library and your data will become the entry point
* A best food on library for you is what we need 
* Matching the data is the process
* Exit point  
```
Here on this section, we will explain about our way on making the mapping using layout diagram. We are going to get it applicable for all the above mappings.
##Symbol
See that all of the mappings are consist of four (4) elements which function in all of mappings are the same. So we can define a symbolization for each of elements. 

Let's put this way:
```
1. A straight line for entry point
2. A text to define what we need
4. A box to indicate the process 
2. A Dotted line for exit point
``` 
![hyipworld flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure1.png)  
The diagram as shown in _Figure 1_ has four (4) elements. Each represent each element inside the mapping. We just need to put _what we need_ as a text above the box. 

Let's take a look into each mapping one by one. You may find that in our case this text can be each of the followings:
* `Food`
* `Library`
* `Your Data`
* `An information of best food`  
* `A best food on library for you`
  
To identify each of them, here we simply put the word `info` above the box. Basically it can be any word you want. Let's take this word to continue further.

##Identification
The further step is we are going to identify the process inside the box. This will become a repository. We shall better provide it with a documentation to describe the process. 

So let's put a repo and a wiki inside the box.  
![hyipworld flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure2.png)  
##Navigation  
As we are going to make a flow system on this project then in order to have a clear navigation we need to define a flowing diagram between the repo and the wiki. Let's put it this way:  
![hyipworld flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure3.png)
##Displaying
We will need also to display the process to the web. Here we make a separation between the flowing of the process to become able to be displayed. 

We also need to give a different title of on it to be easily defined. So just simply make the same diagram but add another word to the process of this displaying. Here we put our project name `hyip` as our choice on the displaying process.   

Here is now the diagram will look like:  
![hyipworld flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure4.png)  

You can see that this mapping has four (4) elements, consist of two (2) repos and two (2) wikis. Just like the number of elements inside a routines.
```
* Hungry will become an entry point
* Food is what we need 
* Eat is the process
* Exit point  
```

Until this point the diagram for a mapping is completed.

#What's Next
We are going to explain further what going on with a basic diagram when we are putting a parameter into of a routine process. 

##Behaviour
Now we are going to explain the behaviour of a mapping when a parameter is putting inside. On our case you are going to put `the best` as your parameter to your food.
 
Let's take mapping of _Figure 4_ as _[[a routine|Mapping#routines]]_.  
![hyipworld flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure4.png)  
Let put again the mapping here.
```  
* Hungry will become an entry point
* Food is what we need 
* Eat is the process
* Exit point  
```
Take a look at the process. Eat is the process. Consider it as a routine process. What is going on when you want to find your best food to eat but you don't know yet which one is.

Of course you remain eat whatever the food you have on hand. Since you insist to get one so you will have to do something to get it.

So here for sure your routine will not be the same again. You have to do another effort out of your routines. Another effort means another process. 

In our case this will consist of _two (2) identical_ processes of eating a food which are:
 
* one process is remain eating _your original food_
* another new process which is the process of eating _your best food_

As we have explained in the _[[settlement|Mapping#settlement]]_ about the behavior of this concept, whenever an identical process is founded then the system will call for _a comparison_.

This comparison process will let the one which giving a better result to take the position as the part of the main process. 

The one which is not taken in the position will keep remain stay but no more carry out. It will stay as a reference or a back-up.

Consider is a sense way. When you have already know what your best food is then for sure you have to choose whether you remain back to your original routines or change your routines to the new process.  

_You cannot carry out both all together in the same time_.

##Mitosis
In our concept another process means another mapping. We are going to explain further how a mapping will become _two (2)_. 

You won't believe us that this kind of process is happen as a normal case in our live. It is happen in your routines especially when you want something to get. 

It is happen on a wider thing like the routines in a company when they shall make a change on their management structure or makes its branches for a development.

It is even happen normally on a smallest thing that you can find it lives in this world !

What is the smallest thing? A cell right? Do you know how many cells in your body? Do you know how your body is having so many cells from you baby time till as big as you are right now? How many of them is making a separation from one (1) to become two (2) each day?

So just to make it short, this kind of process can be identical with when a kind of cell is separated into _two (2) identical sets_, which people call the process as a _[[mitosis|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitosis]]_.

Here is the process look likes:  

![mitosos](https://tophyipmonitor.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/mitosis.jpg)  

The process mitosis of a cell to become two (2) identical sets is consist of _four (4) steps_. 

As we have explained above about the _[[behaviour|Mapping-Routine#behaviour]]_, in our concept the final result will also produce _two (2) identical sets_. 

The step up to the final result will also consist of _four (4) steps_ which we call them as _[[spreading|Mapping-Spreading]], [[employment|Mapping-Employment]], [[merging|Mapping-Merging]] and [[settlement|Mapping-Settlement]]_. 

We are going to bring you to find them in more details one by one.  
Let's start first on _[[Spreading|Mapping-Spreading]]_.
