#Merging

Now we will explain about _a merging_ in our concept. The process of _[[The Last Employment|Mapping-Employment#the-last-one]]_. Please be prepared your self as this section is the hardest part to follow. 

_Here we do our best to explain as you might get confused. However, in order to get easier on following this section we recommend you to make clear yourself to our [[previous section|Mapping-Employment]]_.

##Basic
Let's put again all of the mappings here:
###Routine
Mapping of _[[a routine|Mapping#Routine]]_
```  
* Hungry will become an entry point
* Food is what we need 
* Eat is the process
* Exit point  
```
###Parameter
Mappings by _[[a parameter|Mapping#parameter]]_  

Mapping of the change to your routine process:
```
* Looking for your best food will become an entry point
* An information of best food is what we need 
* Looking is the process
* Exit point  
```
Mapping of the process to collect the library in related with the food:
```
* Food will become an entry point
* Library is what we need 
* Collect is the process
* Exit point  
```
Then we need also the mapping to examine your self to get your data:
```
* You will become an entry point
* Your data is what we need 
* Examine is the process
* Exit point  
```
Let's map about the process of getting the best food for you the same way as your doctor do:
```
* Both of food library and your data will become the entry point
* A best food on library for you is what we need 
* Matching the data is the process
* Exit point  
```
##_The Fourth_
Base the method of mapping, as you have found the the _[[previous section|Mapping-Employment]]_, we have defined _[[the three (3) employments|Mapping-Employment#the-three]]_ that represent the first three (3) of our mappings.

So now it is left only the last one. Let put the mapping here:
```
* Both of food library and your data will become the entry point
* A best food on library for you is what we need 
* Matching the data is the process
* Exit point  
```
See that this mapping is also a process just the same as other mappings. However instead of looking for a kind of a process, this mapping is simply bring all other mapping into its process.

Therefore the kind of employment that represent this mapping will also bring _[[the three (3) employments|Mapping-Employment#the-three]]_ into the employment task. In our concept we call this process as _a merging_.

This will make the number of all employments even. It will be also four (4) exactly the same number as when we do every step of mapping of this concept since the beginning.
###Diagrams
Counting sequentially from _a routine_, _a spreading_, and _an employment_ then _a merging_ stand as _the fourth (4th) unique process_ in our concept.

See also that the 1st Employment is produced by _a spreading_, the 2nd and 3rd are produced by _an employment_. The basic different with other employments is that _The Fourth is not produced_. 

Let put again all the diagrams that we have got until the _[[previous section|Mapping-Employment]]_.

![hyipworld flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure5.png)

![hyipworld flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure9.png)   
###Rules of Merging
See that there is a separated line. The line is separating a dotted line. Means they are the exit points. Here we can place another employment.  
![Flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure10.png)  
###Start Puttting
Let start put the Employment of [[HYIP Monitoring & Rating|Mapping-Employment#hyip-monitoring--rating]]
![Flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure11.png)  
###Breaking
See that a _dotted line_ is meeting a _straight line_ which not correct. You cannot put another Employment that breaking in the middle into a process that are still not settled.  
![Flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure12.png)  
###Solution
See that the Employment has also a dotted line. Here you can break it, let try to put _the rating_ first into the Merging. So the result will be as below:   
![Flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure13.png)    
Here you will get the correct merging!
##Collect
If you have followed the _[[previous section|Mapping-Merging]]_ you can take the result as shown below. 
![Flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure13.png)  
Mapping of the process to collect the library in related with the food:
```
* Food will become an entry point
* Library is what we need 
* Collect is the process
* Exit point  
```
##Examine
![Flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure14.png)  
Then the digram will be as below:
![Flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure15.png)  
Then we need also the mapping to examine your self to get your data:
```
* You will become an entry point
* Your data is what we need 
* Examine is the process
* Exit point  
```
Till this point all of employment task is completed.

Let's turn the diagram the flow above left to right.   
Try to compare with _<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA#Replication" target="_blank">DNA Replication</a>_ as shown in the figure below:    
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA#Replication" target="_blank"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8f/DNA_replication_en.svg"></a>  

Are both identical? Is there a correlation between them?  
We leave that question to yourself.  

##Diagram
Let's clean the mapping that we get on the last result, now we can get it as shown below:  
![Flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure16.png)  
This is the result of the employment of _The Fourth_. The same as other mappings, this result has also four (4) parts, each of them are separated by a line.

Until this point our section for _a merging_ is completed.

#What's Next 
You may see that the result is remain consist of _[[the three (3) employments|Mapping-Employment#the-three]]_. Each of them has _four (4) processes_ that remain become _twelve (12) processes_ all together. You may count also that _this twelve_ is also remain consist of _six (6) main_ & _six (6) displaying_ processes. 

**So where is _The Fourth_ then?**

You may agree that _The Fourth_ is not ever seen anywhere. But in fact _The Fourth_ is _THE ONE_ that bring the _[[routine|Mapping-Routine]]_, _[[spreading|Mapping-Spreading]]_, _[[employments|Mapping-Employment]]_ all together.

So it means that _The Fourth_ is exist from the beginning till the end. _The Fourth_ is exist everywhere. From the smallest thing till the biggest part. So _The Fourth_ is overall. 

**Without _The Fourth_ all is nothing!** 

You may found that on every step of process, we always gave you an example or more in sense way on our daily lives for a kind of every processes that we presented. 

Here we apologize for not doing so. 

Since the time when we found this concept, we took our position to always give our respect to _The Fourth_. So we leave this to you as you may find such of the sense way by yourself. 

Let's continue on the _[[next section|Mapping-Settlement]]_.
