#Merging

Now we will explain about the merging in our concept. We are going to put the diagrams all together. Please be prepared your self as this section is the hardest part to follow. 

_Here we do our best to explain as you might get confused. However we recommend you to make clear your self to our [[previous section|[Mapping]-Employment]] in order to get easier on following this section._

##Concept of Merging
###Basic Rules
Let put again the diagram we have got on [[previous section|[Mapping]-Concept]] 
![hyipworld flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure6.png)  
###Placement
See that there is a separated line. The line is separating a dotted line. Means they are the exit points. Here we can place another employment.  
![Flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure10.png)  
##First Merging
###Start Puttting
Let start put the Employment of [[HYIP Monitoring & Rating|[Mapping]-Employment#hyip-monitoring--rating]]
![Flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure11.png)  
###Breaking
See that a _dotted line_ is meeting a _straight line_ which not correct. You cannot put another Employment that breaking in the middle into a process that are still not settled.  
![Flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure12.png)  
###Solution
See that the Employment has also a dotted line. Here you can break it, let try to put _the rating_ first into the Merging. So the result will be as below:   
![Flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure13.png)    
Here you will get the correct merging!
##Further Step
###Repeating
Start again to place another employment.  
![Flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure14.png)  
Let put the 3rd Employment: [[HYIP Scripting & Team Work|[Mapping]-Employment#scripting--team-work]]  
###Settlement
![Flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure15.png)  
See that the meeting points off all dotted lines and straight lines are correct. All is settled.

#What's Next
You have come to the end of our concept. Hopefully you can follow and enable to understand to what we have explained. 

Please check the appearance of the result as we have explained on the last page of this section titled _[[Overall Mapping|[Mapping]-Overall]]_.
