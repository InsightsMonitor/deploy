#Merging

Now we will explain about the merging in our concept. We are going to put the concept all together. Please be prepared your self as this section is the hardest part to follow. 

_Here we do our best to explain as you might get confused. However we recommend you to make clear your self to our [[previous section|[Mapping]-Employment]] in order to get easier on following this section._

##Concept of Merging
Let put again the diagram we have got on [[previous section|[Mapping]-Concept]] 
![hyipworld flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure6.png)  
See that there is a separated line. Here we can place another employment.  
![Flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure10.png)  
Let start put the Employment of [[HYIP Monitoring & Rating|[Mapping]-Employment#hyip-monitoring--rating]]
![Flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure11.png)  
See that a _dotted line_ is meeting a _straight line_ which not correct.
