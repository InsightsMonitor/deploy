#Employment

In this section we will explain about the employment in our concept. Please note that we are going deeper and deeper. You have to have an open mind. If you're not enjoying it, don't do it.

_Here we do our best to explain as you might get confused. However we recommend you to make clear your self to our [[previous section|[Mapping]-Concept]] in order to get easier on following this section._
##Standardization  
As you may see, every process will be a different. All is unique. So we can now put the mapping schema into a standardization as shown below:

##HYIP Monitoring & Rating  
To became a valuable info then we need to rate the info. The info it self is got from searching and investigation which in hyip business is known as hyip site monitoring or in a short: hyip monitor.  
![Flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure8.png)
##Scripting and Team Work
An important thing is what we will do with achieve it. Rating is process of sorting and Monitoring is process to gain the data. So the rating will need a script and monitoring will need a team.    
![Flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure9.png)

Combining with the first Employment we have now 3 kind of them which are:  
1. : info - world  
2. <a href="#hyip-monitoring--rating">HYIP Monitoring & Rating</a>: monitor - rating  
3. <a href="#scripting-and-team-work">Scripting and Team Work</a>: script - team  

Employment can be more deeper or wider depend on our need. We consider these three (3) are suitable enough to start our project on getting it work. 

So let stop getting the employment until this point and start merging them.  
Let continue now with the concept of _[[Merging|[Mapping]-Merging]]_.
