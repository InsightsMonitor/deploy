#Employment

In this section we will explain about the employment in our concept. Please note that we are going deeper and deeper. 

_Here we do our best to explain as you might get confused. However we recommend you to make clear your self to our [[previous section|[Mapping]-Concept]] in order to get easier on following this section._
##Standardization  
Let put again the diagram we have got on [[previous section|[Mapping]-Concept]]   
![hyipworld flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure6.png)  
As you may see, every process will be a different. All is unique. So we can now put the mapping schema into a standardization as shown below:  
![Flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure7.png)  

So in line to what he have explained about _[[isogram|Mapping#nonpattern-word-isogram]]_ here you can see the breakdown of the assigned letters as below: 
```js
letter a stand as info  
letter b stand as world  
letter c stand as hyip  
```
##HYIP Monitoring & Rating  
To became a valuable info then we need to rate the info. The info it self is got from searching and investigation which in hyip business is known as hyip site monitoring or in a short: hyip monitor.  
```js
letter a stand as monitor  
letter b stand as rating  
letter c stand as hyip  
```
Then diagram will be shown as below:  
![Flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure8.png)
##Scripting & Team Work
An important thing is what we will do with achieve it. Rating is process of sorting and Monitoring is process to gain the data. So the rating will need a script and monitoring will need a team.    
```js
letter a stand as script  
letter b stand as team  
letter c stand as hyip  
```
Then diagram will be shown as below:  
![Flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure9.png)

Combining all together we have now 3 kind of Employments which are:  
 
_1. [[HYIP Info & World|[Mapping]-Concept#settlement]]: info - world_  
_2. [[HYIP Monitoring & Rating|[Mapping]-Employment#hyip-monitoring--rating]]</a>: monitor - rating_  
_3. [[HYIP Scripting & Team Work|[Mapping]-Employment#scripting--team-work]]: script - team_  

#What's Next
Employment can be more deeper or wider depend on our need. We consider these three (3) are suitable enough to start our project on getting it work. 

So let stop getting the employment until this point and start merging them.  
Let continue now with the concept of _[[Merging|[Mapping]-Merging]]_.
