#Employment

In this section we will explain about the employment in our concept. Please note that we are going deeper and deeper. 

_Here we do our best to explain as you might get confused. However, in order to get easier on following this section we recommend you to make clear yourself to our [[previous section|[Mapping]-Concept]]._
##Basic  
Let's put again the mapping here:
```
* Hungry will become an entry point
* Food is what we need 
* Eat is the process
* Exit point  
```
Mapping of the process to collect the library in related with the food:
```
* Food will become an entry point
* Library is what we need 
* Collect is the process
* Exit point  
```
Then we need also the mapping to examine your self to get your data:
```
* You will become an entry point
* Your data is what we need 
* Examine is the process
* Exit point  
```
Let's map about the process of getting the best food for you the same way as your doctor do:
```
* Both of food library and your data will become the entry point
* A best food on library for you is what we need 
* Matching the data is the process
* Exit point  
```

##Separation
Now we are going to explain the behaviour of a mapping when a parameter is putting inside.
Le's take mapping of _Figure 4_ as the routines one.  
Let put again one of the mapping here.
```  
* Hungry will become an entry point
* Food is what we need 
* Eat is the process
* Exit point  
```
Take a look at the process. Eat is the process. How to make sure that the process of eating is done? We have to know it in order that this process is done. This for sure it will become another process.

So when applying this all together then the diagram will be shown as below:  
![hyipworld flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure5.png)
```
* You will become an entry point
* Your data is what we need 
* Examine is the process
* Exit point  
```
##Settlement
A process is considered as settled whenever it can be run or return to the entry point and processed normally without any adjustment or modification into the routines.

For instance, let say you have eat the food, then you got that it is not suit to your need. Means it is not the best one for you. So you need to do the searching again at which the process back to the entry point again.   
![hyipworld flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure6.png)


##1st-Employment
Let put again the diagram we have got on [[previous section|[Mapping]-Concept]]   
![hyipworld flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure6.png)  
As you may see, every process will be a different. All is unique. So we can now put the mapping schema into a standardization as shown below:  
![Flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure7.png)  

So in line to what he have explained about _[[isogram|Mapping#nonpattern-word-isogram]]_ here you can see the breakdown of the assigned letters as below: 
```js
letter a stand as info  
letter b stand as world  
letter c stand as hyip  
```
##2nd-Employment
To became a valuable info then we need to rate the info. The info it self is got from searching and investigation which in hyip business is known as hyip site monitoring or in a short: hyip monitor.  
```js
letter a stand as monitor  
letter b stand as rating  
letter c stand as hyip  
```
Then diagram will be shown as below:  
![Flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure8.png)
##3rd-Employment
An important thing is what we will do with achieve it. Rating is process of sorting and Monitoring is process to gain the data. So the rating will need a script and monitoring will need a team.    
```js
letter a stand as script  
letter b stand as team  
letter c stand as hyip  
```
Then diagram will be shown as below:  
![Flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure9.png)

Combining all together we have now 3 kind of Employments which are:  
 
_1. [[Info & World|[Mapping]-Concept#settlement]]: info - world_  
_2. [[Monitor & Rating|[Mapping]-Employment#hyip-monitoring--rating]]</a>: monitor - rating_  
_3. [[Script & Team|[Mapping]-Employment#scripting--team-work]]: script - team_  

#What's Next
Employment can be more deeper or wider depend on our need. We consider these three (3) are suitable enough to start our project on getting it work. 

So let stop getting the employment until this point and start merging them.  
Let continue now with the concept of _[[Merging|[Mapping]-Merging]]_.
