#Employment

In this section we will explain about the employment in our concept. Please note that we are going deeper and deeper. 

_Here we do our best to explain as you might get confused. However, in order to get easier on following this section we recommend you to make clear yourself to our [[previous section|[Mapping]-Concept]]._
##Basic  
Let's put again the mapping here:
```
* Hungry will become an entry point
* Food is what we need 
* Eat is the process
* Exit point  
```
Mapping of the process to collect the library in related with the food:
```
* Food will become an entry point
* Library is what we need 
* Collect is the process
* Exit point  
```
Then we need also the mapping to examine your self to get your data:
```
* You will become an entry point
* Your data is what we need 
* Examine is the process
* Exit point  
```
Let's map about the process of getting the best food for you the same way as your doctor do:
```
* Both of food library and your data will become the entry point
* A best food on library for you is what we need 
* Matching the data is the process
* Exit point  
```

##Behaviour
Now we are going to explain the behaviour of a mapping when a parameter is putting inside.
Let's take mapping of _Figure 4_ as the routines one.  
![hyipworld flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure4.png)  
Let put again the mapping here.
```  
* Hungry will become an entry point
* Food is what we need 
* Eat is the process
* Exit point  
```
Take a look at the process. Eat is the process. Consider it as a routine process. What is going on when you want to find a best to eat but you don't know yet which one is.

Of course you remain eat whatever the food you have on hand. Since you insist to get one so you will have to do something to get it.

So here for sure your routine will not be the same again. You have to do another effort out of your routines. Another effort means another process. In our concept another process means another mapping. In this project another mapping means another repository.

##Spreading
Based on the concept of mapping then a new process shall follow these basic rules:
* Have one assigned main process and one assigned displaying process
* The title of the process shall be different with the routines
  
Let's take again the mapping of the routines    
![hyipworld flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure4.png)   
As we have explained, on the basic concept of mapping, you can put whatever word you like to name a new process.
   
So simply make it a copy of the routines, put another word to replace the word of `info`, let's take the word of `world` then. So now you have two mapping with a different process. One for your routines and another one for the new process.

Now left the question on how to combine them, right? Here are the rules:  
* The new process shall be able to be carried out along with the routines
* It shall be a clearly sign that a new process is being carried out of the routines

So when applying this all together then the diagram will be shown as below:  
![hyipworld flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure5.png)

In our concept we call this kind of mapping as _an employment._ You can see that this mapping has four (4) elements, just like the number of elements inside a routines.

#Assignment
This is the behaviour of our mapping when a parameter is put inside the routines. Since there 2 process are generated that the behavior of our mapping will seeking another process to return to its routine. 

We will explain further how these mapping are going to present the process of followings:
  
Mapping of the process to collect the library in related with the food:
```
* Food will become an entry point
* Library is what we need 
* Collect is the process
* Exit point  
```
Then we need also the mapping to examine your self to get your data:
```
* You will become an entry point
* Your data is what we need 
* Examine is the process
* Exit point  
```
##Basic
A process is considered as settled whenever it can be run or return to the entry point and processed normally without any adjustment or modification into the routines.

For instance, let say you have eat the food, then you got that it is not suit to your need. Means it is not the best one for you. So you need to do the searching again at which the process back to the entry point again.

##1st-Employment
Let put again the diagram we have got on [[previous section|[Mapping]-Concept]]   
![hyipworld flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure6.png)  
As you may see, every process will be a different. All is unique. So we can now put the mapping schema into a standardization as shown below:  
![Flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure7.png)  

So in line to what he have explained about _[[isogram|Mapping#nonpattern-word-isogram]]_ here you can see the breakdown of the assigned letters as below: 
```js
letter a stand as info  
letter b stand as world  
letter c stand as hyip  
```
##2nd-Employment
To became a valuable info then we need to rate the info. The info it self is got from searching and investigation which in hyip business is known as hyip site monitoring or in a short: hyip monitor.  
```js
letter a stand as monitor  
letter b stand as rating  
letter c stand as hyip  
```
Then diagram will be shown as below:  
![Flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure8.png)
##3rd-Employment
An important thing is what we will do with achieve it. Rating is process of sorting and Monitoring is process to gain the data. So the rating will need a script and monitoring will need a team.    
```js
letter a stand as script  
letter b stand as team  
letter c stand as hyip  
```
Then diagram will be shown as below:  
![Flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure9.png)

#What's Next
Combining all together we have now 3 kind of Employments which are:  
 
_1. [[Info & World|[Mapping]-Concept#settlement]]: info - world_  
_2. [[Monitor & Rating|[Mapping]-Employment#hyip-monitoring--rating]]</a>: monitor - rating_  
_3. [[Script & Team|[Mapping]-Employment#scripting--team-work]]: script - team_  

Employment can be more deeper or wider depend on our need. We consider these three (3) are suitable enough to start our project on getting it work. 

You may see that each kind of these (3) employments has four (4) elements, become twelve (12) all together. This twelve elements consist of six (6) users & six (6) organizations.

So let stop getting the employment until this point and start merging them. Let continue now with the concept of _[[Merging|[Mapping]-Merging]]_.
