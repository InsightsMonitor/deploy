= Merging =

Now we will explain about ''a merging'' in our concept. The process of ''[[Mapping-Employment#the-last-one|The Last Employment]]''. Please be prepared your self as this section is the hardest part to follow. 

''Here we do our best to explain as you might get confused. However, in order to get easier on following this section we recommend you to make clear yourself to our [[Mapping-Employment|previous section]]''.

== ''The Fourth'' ==
Combining all together we have now 3 kind of Employments which are:<br />   
''1. [[Mapping-Employment#1st-employment|Info & World]]: info - world'' <br /> 
''2. [[Mapping-Employment#2nd-employment|Monitor & Rating]]: monitor - rating'' <br /> 
''3. [[Mapping-Employment#3rd-employment|Script & Team]]: script - team''  

Employment can be all kind of process that you want. In our concept we just need ''three (3) of employments''. One for Routine, and the other two for the process in related to the parameter.

You may see that each kind of these ''three (3) of employments'' has four (4) processes, becoming twelve (12)  processes all together.

We have pronounced since the beginning that all the mappings has always got ''four (4) parts''. 

Either mapping for ''[[Mapping-Routine|a routine]]'', diagram for ''[[Mapping-Spreading|a spreading]]'', also for an employment. All of them got always ''four (4) parts'' So why we only take ''three (3) of employments''. Not four (4)? 

Actually there is ''The Fourth (4th)''. Stand as ''The Last Employment''. Very special. The key of all this concept. So let's stop the employments until this point. 

Base the method of mapping, as you have found the the ''[[Mapping-Employment|previous section]]'', we have defined ''[[Mapping-Employment#the-three|the three (3) employments]]'' that represent the first three (3) of our mappings.

So now it is left only the last one. Let put the mapping here:
```
* Both of food library and your data will become the entry point
* A best food on library for you is what we need 
* Matching the data is the process
* Exit point  
```
See that this mapping is also a process just the same as other mappings. However instead of looking for a kind of a process, this mapping is simply bring all other mapping into its process.<br /><br />

Therefore the kind of employment that represent this mapping will also bring ''[[Mapping-Employment#the-three|the three (3) employments]]'' into the employment task. In our concept we call this process as ''a merging''.<br />

This will make the number of all employments even. It will be also four (4) exactly the same number as when we do every step of mapping of this concept since the beginning.

Counting sequentially from ''a routine'', ''a spreading'', and ''an employment'' then ''a merging'' stand as ''the fourth (4th) unique process'' in our concept.

See also that the 1st Employment is produced by ''a spreading'', the 2nd and 3rd are produced by ''an employment''. The basic different with other employments is that ''The Fourth is not produced''. 
=== 1st Placement ===
Let put again all the diagrams that we have got until the ''[[Mapping-Employment|previous section]]''.
[[<img src="https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure4.png">]] 
[[<img src="https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure5.png">]]  
[[<img src="https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure6.png">]]   
[[<img src="https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure7.png">]]   
[[<img src="https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure8.png">]]   
[[<img src="https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure9.png">]]   

See that there is a separated line. The line is separating a dotted line. Means they are the exit points. Here we can place another employment.  
[[<img src="https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure10.png">]]  
=== 2nd Placement ===
Let start put the Employment of [[Mapping-Employment#hyip-monitoring--rating|HYIP Monitoring & Rating]]
[[<img src="https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure11.png">]]  

See that a ''dotted line'' is meeting a ''straight line'' which not correct. You cannot put another Employment that breaking in the middle into a process that are still not settled.  
[[<img src="https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure12.png">]]  

See that the Employment has also a dotted line. Here you can break it, let try to put ''the rating'' first into the Merging. So the result will be as below:   
[[<img src="https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure13.png">]]<br />
Mapping of the process to collect the library in related with the food:
```
* Food will become an entry point
* Library is what we need 
* Collect is the process
* Exit point  
```
Here you get the correct merging! 
=== 3rd Placement ===
[[<img src="https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure14.png">]]<br /> 
Then the digram will be as below:
[[<img src="https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure15.png">]]<br /> 
Then we need also the mapping to examine your self to get your data:
```
* You will become an entry point
* Your data is what we need 
* Examine is the process
* Exit point  
```

== Route ==
Let's clean the mapping that we get on the last result, now we can get it as shown below:  
[[<img src="https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure16.png">]]  

This is the result of the employment of ''The Fourth''. The same as other mappings, this result has also four (4) parts, each of them are separated by a line.
=== Flow ===
Now we are going to tabulate the flow of ''a merging'' similar to what we done for each of the employments. Let's put again all of the tabulations here.

=== Overall ===
Let's try to tabulate the flow diagram on the merging. Take only the arrow flow on each employments and connect them each others. You will find then the flow as shown below:
<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td><strong><i>R</i></strong></td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td></tr>

  </tbody>
</table>

If you find the same as shown on the above tabulation then let's turn it around from the left to right (just like when you see it from the backside).    

Now, try to compare the flow that you see with the process of ''<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA#Replication" target="_blank">DNA Replication</a>'' when they are on the process to be joined together as shown in the figure below:
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8f/DNA_replication_en.svg">  

Are the both identical? Is there any correlation between them?<br />  
We leave the answer of this question to yourself.  

Until this point our section for ''a merging'' is completed.

== Accomplishment ==

Let's put again the diagram of ''a merging'' here:  
[[<img src="https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure16.png">]]  

You may see that the result is remain consist of ''[[Mapping-Employment#the-three|the three (3) employments]]''. Each of them has ''four (4) processes'' that remain become ''twelve (12) processes'' all together. 

You may count also that ''this twelve'' processes are also remain consist of ''six (6) main'' & ''six (6) displaying'' processes exactly the same when we collect ''[[Mapping-Employment#the-three|the three (3) employments]]''. 

'''So where is ''The Fourth'' then?'''

You may agree that ''The Fourth'' is not ever seen anywhere. But in fact ''The Fourth'' is ''THE ONE'' that bring the merging of ''[[Mapping-Routine|a routine]]'', ''[[Mapping-Spreading|a spreading]]'', ''[[Mapping-Employment|an employment]]'' all together.

So it means that ''The Fourth'' is exist from the beginning till the end. ''The Fourth'' is exist everywhere. From the smallest thing till the biggest part. So ''The Fourth'' is overall. 

'''Without ''The Fourth'' all is nothing!''' 

You may found that on every step of process, we always gave you an example or more in sense way on our daily lives for a kind of every processes that we presented. 

Here we apologize for not doing so. 

Since the time when we found this concept, we took our position to always give our respect to ''The Fourth''. So, again, we leave this to you as you may find such of the sense way by yourself. 

Let's continue on the ''[[Mapping-Settlement|next section]]''.
