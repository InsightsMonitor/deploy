= Merging =

Now we will explain about ''a merging'' in our concept. The process of ''[[Mapping-Employment#the-last-one|The Last Employment]]''. Please be prepared your self as this section is the hardest part to follow. 

''Here we do our best to explain as you might get confused. However, in order to get easier on following this section we recommend you to make clear yourself to our [[Mapping-Employment|previous section]]''.

== Basic ==
Let's put again all of the mappings here:
=== Routine ===
Mapping of ''[[Mapping#Routine|a routine]]''
```  
* Hungry will become an entry point
* Food is what we need 
* Eat is the process
* Exit point  
```
=== Parameter ===
Mappings by ''[[Mapping#parameter|a parameter]]''  

Mapping of the change to your routine process:
```
* Looking for your best food will become an entry point
* An information of best food is what we need 
* Looking is the process
* Exit point  
```
Mapping of the process to collect the library in related with the food:
```
* Food will become an entry point
* Library is what we need 
* Collect is the process
* Exit point  
```
Then we need also the mapping to examine your self to get your data:
```
* You will become an entry point
* Your data is what we need 
* Examine is the process
* Exit point  
```
Let's map about the process of getting the best food for you the same way as your doctor do:
```
* Both of food library and your data will become the entry point
* A best food on library for you is what we need 
* Matching the data is the process
* Exit point  
```
== ''The Fourth'' ==
Base the method of mapping, as you have found the the ''[[Mapping-Employment|previous section]]'', we have defined ''[[Mapping-Employment#the-three|the three (3) employments]]'' that represent the first three (3) of our mappings.

So now it is left only the last one. Let put the mapping here:
```
* Both of food library and your data will become the entry point
* A best food on library for you is what we need 
* Matching the data is the process
* Exit point  
```
See that this mapping is also a process just the same as other mappings. However instead of looking for a kind of a process, this mapping is simply bring all other mapping into its process.

Therefore the kind of employment that represent this mapping will also bring ''[[Mapping-Employment#the-three|the three (3) employments]]'' into the employment task. In our concept we call this process as ''a merging''.

This will make the number of all employments even. It will be also four (4) exactly the same number as when we do every step of mapping of this concept since the beginning.
=== Diagrams ===
Counting sequentially from ''a routine'', ''a spreading'', and ''an employment'' then ''a merging'' stand as ''the fourth (4th) unique process'' in our concept.

See also that the 1st Employment is produced by ''a spreading'', the 2nd and 3rd are produced by ''an employment''. The basic different with other employments is that ''The Fourth is not produced''. 

Let put again all the diagrams that we have got until the ''[[Mapping-Employment|previous section]]''.
![hyipworld flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure4.png)  
![hyipworld flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure5.png)  
![hyipworld flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure6.png)   
![hyipworld flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure7.png)   
![hyipworld flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure8.png)   
![hyipworld flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure9.png)   
=== Rules of Merging ===
See that there is a separated line. The line is separating a dotted line. Means they are the exit points. Here we can place another employment.  
![Flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure10.png)  
=== Start Puttting ===
Let start put the Employment of [[Mapping-Employment#hyip-monitoring--rating|HYIP Monitoring & Rating]]
![Flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure11.png)  
=== Breaking ===
See that a ''dotted line'' is meeting a ''straight line'' which not correct. You cannot put another Employment that breaking in the middle into a process that are still not settled.  
![Flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure12.png)  
=== Solution ===
See that the Employment has also a dotted line. Here you can break it, let try to put ''the rating'' first into the Merging. So the result will be as below:   
![Flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure13.png)    
Here you will get the correct merging!
== Collect ==
If you have followed the ''[[Mapping-Merging|previous section]]'' you can take the result as shown below. 
![Flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure13.png)  
Mapping of the process to collect the library in related with the food:
```
* Food will become an entry point
* Library is what we need 
* Collect is the process
* Exit point  
```
== Examine ==
![Flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure14.png)  
Then the digram will be as below:
![Flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure15.png)  
Then we need also the mapping to examine your self to get your data:
```
* You will become an entry point
* Your data is what we need 
* Examine is the process
* Exit point  
```

= Overall =
Let's clean the mapping that we get on the last result, now we can get it as shown below:  
![Flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure16.png)  
== Diagram ==
This is the result of the employment of ''The Fourth''. The same as other mappings, this result has also four (4) parts, each of them are separated by a line.

== Flow ==
Now we are going to tabulate the flow of ''a merging'' similar to what we done for each of the employments. Let's put again all of the tabulations here.

=== Overall Flow Tabulation ===
Let's try to tabulate the flow diagram on the merging. Take only the arrow flow on each employments and connect them each others. You will find then the flow as shown below:
<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td><strong><i>R</i></strong></td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td></tr>

</table>

If you find the same as above, let's turn the diagram left to right (or see it from backside).   
Now, try to compare with the process of ''<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA#Replication" target="_blank">DNA Replication</a>'' as shown in the figure below:    
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA#Replication" target="_blank"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8f/DNA_replication_en.svg"></a>  

Are both identical? Is there a correlation between them?  
We leave the answer of this question to yourself.  

Until this point our section for ''a merging'' is completed.

= What's Next =
You may see that the result is remain consist of ''[[Mapping-Employment#the-three|the three (3) employments]]''. Each of them has ''four (4) processes'' that remain become ''twelve (12) processes'' all together. You may count also that ''this twelve'' is also remain consist of ''six (6) main'' & ''six (6) displaying'' processes. 

**So where is ''The Fourth'' then?**

You may agree that ''The Fourth'' is not ever seen anywhere. But in fact ''The Fourth'' is ''THE ONE'' that bring the ''[[Mapping-Routine|routine]]'', ''[[Mapping-Spreading|spreading]]'', ''[[Mapping-Employment|employments]]'' all together.

So it means that ''The Fourth'' is exist from the beginning till the end. ''The Fourth'' is exist everywhere. From the smallest thing till the biggest part. So ''The Fourth'' is overall. 

**Without ''The Fourth'' all is nothing!** 

You may found that on every step of process, we always gave you an example or more in sense way on our daily lives for a kind of every processes that we presented. 

Here we apologize for not doing so. 

Since the time when we found this concept, we took our position to always give our respect to ''The Fourth''. So we leave this to you as you may find such of the sense way by yourself. 

Let's continue on the ''[[Mapping-Settlement|next section]]''.
