#Mapping the Concept

We have explained the [[background of our concept|Mapping]]. Now we will explain the mapping of this project. Please be prepared your self as we are going deeper ongoing forward.

##Basic
Let's put again all of the mappings here:
```
* Hungry will become an entry point
* Food is what we need 
* Eat is the process
* Exit point  
```
Mapping of the process to collect the library in related with the food:
```
* Food will become an entry point
* Library is what we need 
* Collect is the process
* Exit point  
```
Then we need also the mapping to examine your self to get your data:
```
* You will become an entry point
* Your data is what we need 
* Examine is the process
* Exit point  
```
Let's map about the process of getting the best food for you the same way as your doctor do:
```
* Both of food library and your data will become the entry point
* A best food on library for you is what we need 
* Matching the data is the process
* Exit point  
```
Here on this section, we will explain about our way on making the mapping using layout diagram. We are going to get it applicable for all the above mappings.
##Symbol
See that all of the mappings are consist of 4 elements which function in all of mappings are the same. So we can define a symbolization for each of elements. Let's take this way:
```
1. A straight line for entry point
2. A text to define what we need
4. A box to indicate the process 
2. A Dotted line for exit point
``` 
![hyipworld flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure1.png)  
The diagram as shown in _Figure 1_ has 4 elements. Each represent each element inside the mapping. We just need to put _what we need_ as a text above the box. 

Let's take a look into each mapping one by one. You may find that in our case this text can be each of the followings:
* `Food`
* `Library`
* `Your Data`
* `A best food on library for you`  
  
To identify each of them, here we simply put the word `info` above the box. Basically it can be any word you want. Let's take this word to continue further.

##Identification
The further step is we are going to identify the process inside the box. This will become a repository. We shall better provide it with a documentation to describe the process. 

So let's put a repo and a wiki inside the box.  
![hyipworld flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure2.png)  
##Navigation  
As we are going to make a flow system on this project then in order to have a clear navigation we need to define a flowing diagram between the repo and the wiki. Let's put it this way:  
![hyipworld flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure3.png)
##Displaying
We will need also to display the process to the web. Here we make a separation between the flowing of the process to becoming able to be displayed.  

We also need to give the title of on it to be easily defined. So just simply put another word on the process of this displaying. Here we put our project name as our choice of this word. 
![hyipworld flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure4.png)
##Expansion
```
* Hungry will become an entry point
* Food is what we need 
* Eat is the process
* Exit point  
```
One thing to be noted that every process above is unique.  
  
_Food_ and the way on getting the _food_ is different scheme.  
The way that the _food_ is reached by _you_ is also different.  

Let try to replace the word of _food_ to _info_, and change _you_ to _the world_:  

_Info_ and the way to getting the _info_ is different scheme.  
The way that the _info_ is reached by _the world_ is also different.  
 
So when applying this all together then the diagram will be shown as below:  
![hyipworld flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure5.png)

##Settlement
A process is considered as settled whenever it can be run or return to the entry point and processed normally without any adjustment or modification into the routines.

For instance, let say you have eat the food, then you got that it is not suit to your need. Means it is not the best one for you. So you need to do the searching again at which the process back to the entry point again.

#What's Next

##Employment
To became a valuable info then we need to rate the info. The info it self is got from searching and investigation which in hyip business is known as hyip site monitoring or in a short: _hyip monitor_.

An important thing is what we will do with achieve it. Rating is process of sorting and Monitoring is process to gain the data. So the rating will need a script and monitoring will need a team. This will be a different process. So all is also unique.
##Merging
Employment of this method can be more deeper depend to our need. We considered this plan is suitable enough to start the process on getting it work. So let stop the employment until this point and start merging them. 

We will explain to how to do the both of in a different section, let start first on _[[Employment|[Mapping]-Employment]]_.
