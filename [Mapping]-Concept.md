#Mapping the Concept

We have explained the [[background of our concept|Mapping]]. Now we will explain the mapping of this project. Please be prepared your self as we are going deeper ongoing forward.

##Basic Rules
Let's put again all of the mapping here:
```
* Hungry will become an entry point
* Food is what we need 
* Eat is the process
* Exit point  
```
Mapping of the process to collect the library in related with the food:
```
* Food will become an entry point
* Library is what we need 
* Collect is the process
* Exit point  
```
Then we need also the mapping to examine your self to get your data:
```
* You will become an entry point
* Your data is what we need 
* Examine is the process
* Exit point  
```
Let's map about the process of getting the best food for you the same way as your doctor do:
```
* Both of food library and your data will become the entry point
* A best food on library for you is what we need 
* Matching the data is the process
* Exit point  
```
Here on this section, we will explain about our way on making the mapping using layout diagram. We are going to get it applicable for all the above mappings.
##Symbol
See that all of the mapping are consist of 4 elements which function an all mappings are the same. So we can define a symbolization for each of elements. Let's take this way:
```
1. A Straight line for entry point
2. A text to define what we need
4. A box to indicate the process 
2. A Dotted line for exit point
```

##Identification
Here we need to describe about the info. So we do the identification on repository and put description on the wiki documentation.

##Processing  
Then how to map the process?
![hyipworld flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure3.png)

##Expansion
Since we took parameter of best for the food so we shall map again the process of getting the best food. Because the best food for you will not be the same one for others.

Here we shall put your criteria inside the parameter. For instance, the parameter shall at least include, your age, your location, your budget, and also your preferences.   
![hyipworld flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure4.png)

##Parameter
One thing to be noted that every process above is unique.  
  
_Food_ and the way on getting the _food_ is different scheme.  
The way that the _food_ is reached by _you_ is also different.  

Let try to replace the word of _food_ to _info_, and change _you_ to _the world_:  

_Info_ and the way to getting the _info_ is different scheme.  
The way that the _info_ is reached by _the world_ is also different.  
 
So when applying this all together then the diagram will be shown as below:  
![hyipworld flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure5.png)

##Settlement
A process is considered as settled whenever it can be run or return to the entry point and processed normally without any adjustment or modification into the routines.

For instance, let say you have eat the food, then you got that it is not suit to your need. Means it is not the best one for you. So you need to do the searching again at which the process back to the entry point again.

#What's Next

##Employment
To became a valuable info then we need to rate the info. The info it self is got from searching and investigation which in hyip business is known as hyip site monitoring or in a short: _hyip monitor_.

An important thing is what we will do with achieve it. Rating is process of sorting and Monitoring is process to gain the data. So the rating will need a script and monitoring will need a team. This will be a different process. So all is also unique.
##Merging
Employment of this method can be more deeper depend to our need. We considered this plan is suitable enough to start the process on getting it work. So let stop the employment until this point and start merging them. 

We will explain to how to do the both of in a different section, let start first on _[[Employment|[Mapping]-Employment]]_.
