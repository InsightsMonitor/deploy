#Mapping the Concept

We have explained the [[background of our concept|Mapping]]. Now we will explain the mapping of this project. Please be prepared your self as we are going deeper ongoing forward.

##Basic
Let's put again all of the mappings here:
```
* Hungry will become an entry point
* Food is what we need 
* Eat is the process
* Exit point  
```
Mapping of the process to collect the library in related with the food:
```
* Food will become an entry point
* Library is what we need 
* Collect is the process
* Exit point  
```
Then we need also the mapping to examine your self to get your data:
```
* You will become an entry point
* Your data is what we need 
* Examine is the process
* Exit point  
```
Let's map about the process of getting the best food for you the same way as your doctor do:
```
* Both of food library and your data will become the entry point
* A best food on library for you is what we need 
* Matching the data is the process
* Exit point  
```
Here on this section, we will explain about our way on making the mapping using layout diagram. We are going to get it applicable for all the above mappings.
##Symbol
See that all of the mappings are consist of 4 elements which function in all of mappings are the same. So we can define a symbolization for each of elements. Let's take this way:
```
1. A straight line for entry point
2. A text to define what we need
4. A box to indicate the process 
2. A Dotted line for exit point
``` 
![hyipworld flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure1.png)  
The diagram as shown in _Figure 1_ has 4 elements. Each represent each element inside the mapping. We just need to put _what we need_ as a text above the box. 

Let's take a look into each mapping one by one. You may find that in our case this text can be each of the followings:
* `Food`
* `Library`
* `Your Data`
* `A best food on library for you`  
  
To identify each of them, here we simply put the word `info` above the box. Basically it can be any word you want. Let's take this word to continue further.

##Identification
The further step is we are going to identify the process inside the box. This will become a repository. We shall better provide it with a documentation to describe the process. 

So let's put a repo and a wiki inside the box.  
![hyipworld flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure2.png)  
##Navigation  
As we are going to make a flow system on this project then in order to have a clear navigation we need to define a flowing diagram between the repo and the wiki. Let's put it this way:  
![hyipworld flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure3.png)
##Displaying
We will need also to display the process to the web. Here we make a separation between the flowing of the process to becoming able to be displayed. 

To make clear separation to the process here we take a new repo and wiki for the displaying purpose. We also need to give the title of on it to be easily defined. 

So just simply make the same diagram but add another word to the process of this displaying. Here is now the diagram will look like: 

![hyipworld flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure4.png)  
Here we put our project name `hyip` as our choice on the displaying process.   
Until this point the diagram for a mapping is completed.

#What's Next
You can consider that the diagram as shown above stand as our basic diagram of a mapping. This diagram is presenting when a process is assigned to do a routine task.
Let's put again all of the mappings here:
```
* Hungry will become an entry point
* Food is what we need 
* Eat is the process
* Exit point  
```
We are going to explain further what going on with a basic diagram when we are putting a parameter into of a routine process. 

From that point you may see that a basic diagram will turn its behaviour and seeking a way to return to its routine by calling another mappings which is in our concept we call them as _Employment_ and _Merging_. 
##Employment
Employment of this method can be more deeper depend to our need. It will be called when a parameter is assigned to a routines.
Mapping of the process to collect the library in related with the food:
```
* Food will become an entry point
* Library is what we need 
* Collect is the process
* Exit point  
```
Then we need also the mapping to examine your self to get your data:
```
* You will become an entry point
* Your data is what we need 
* Examine is the process
* Exit point  
```
Both will be a different process. So all is also unique.
##Merging
Let's map about the process of getting the best food for you the same way as your doctor do:
```
* Both of food library and your data will become the entry point
* A best food on library for you is what we need 
* Matching the data is the process
* Exit point  
```
We considered this plan is suitable enough to start the process on getting it work.

We will explain to how to do the both of in a different section, let start first on _[[Employment|[Mapping]-Employment]]_.
