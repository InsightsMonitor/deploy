#Overall
This page is the last page of this section. From the _[[Employment|[Mapping]-Employment]]_  & _[[Merging|[Mapping]-Merging]]_ concept, here we are going to display the overall mapping to become a settlement.  

_Here we do our best to explain as you might get confused. However, in order to get easier on following this section we recommend you to make clear yourself to our [[previous section|[Mapping]-Merging]]._

##Basic  
Let's put again the mapping here:
```
* Hungry will become an entry point
* Food is what we need 
* Eat is the process
* Exit point  
```
Mapping of the process to collect the library in related with the food:
```
* Food will become an entry point
* Library is what we need 
* Collect is the process
* Exit point  
```
Then we need also the mapping to examine your self to get your data:
```
* You will become an entry point
* Your data is what we need 
* Examine is the process
* Exit point  
```
Let's map about the process of getting the best food for you the same way as your doctor do:
```
* Both of food library and your data will become the entry point
* A best food on library for you is what we need 
* Matching the data is the process
* Exit point  
```
##Collect
If you have followed the _[[previous section|[Mapping]-Merging]]_ you can take the result as shown below.

Mapping of the process to collect the library in related with the food:
```
* Food will become an entry point
* Library is what we need 
* Collect is the process
* Exit point  
```
##Examine

Then the digram will be as below:
![Flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure15.png)  
Then we need also the mapping to examine your self to get your data:
```
* You will become an entry point
* Your data is what we need 
* Examine is the process
* Exit point  
```
##Matching
![hyipworld flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure5.png)  
Let's map about the process of getting the best food for you the same way as your doctor do:
```
* Both of food library and your data will become the entry point
* A best food on library for you is what we need 
* Matching the data is the process
* Exit point  
```

##Settlement
![hyipworld flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure4.png)  
Let's put again the mapping here:
```
* Hungry will become an entry point
* Food is what we need 
* Eat is the process
* Exit point  
```
#What's Next
You have come to the end of our concept. Hopefully you can follow and enable to understand to what we have explained. 

Please check the appearance of all the process on our _[[Project Map|maps]]_.
