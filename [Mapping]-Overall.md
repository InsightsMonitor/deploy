#Overall Mapping
This page is the last page of this section. From the _[[Employment|[Mapping]-Employment]]_  & _[[Merging|[Mapping]-Merging]]_ concept, here we are going to display the overall mapping by [[diagram|[Mapping]-Overall#by-diagram]] and [[tabulation|[Mapping]-Overall#by-tabulation]].  

_Hopefully you can follow and able to understand to what we have explained. You may check if you have made clear yourself by answering [[questionnaire|[Mapping]-Overall#question-for-you]] on the last of this page._

##Basic  
Let's put again the mapping here:
```
* Hungry will become an entry point
* Food is what we need 
* Eat is the process
* Exit point  
```
Mapping of the process to collect the library in related with the food:
```
* Food will become an entry point
* Library is what we need 
* Collect is the process
* Exit point  
```
Then we need also the mapping to examine your self to get your data:
```
* You will become an entry point
* Your data is what we need 
* Examine is the process
* Exit point  
```
Let's map about the process of getting the best food for you the same way as your doctor do:
```
* Both of food library and your data will become the entry point
* A best food on library for you is what we need 
* Matching the data is the process
* Exit point  
```
##By Diagram

Now it is your turn to familiar with the flow on our concept. If you have followed the _[[previous section|[Mapping]-Merging]]_ you can easily figure out the overall result as shown below.

Mapping of the process to collect the library in related with the food:
```

##By Tabulation
![hyipworld flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure5.png)  
Let's map about the process of getting the best food for you the same way as your doctor do:
```
* Both of food library and your data will become the entry point
* A best food on library for you is what we need 
* Matching the data is the process
* Exit point  
```

##By Settlement
![hyipworld flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure4.png)  
Let's put again the mapping here:
```
* Hungry will become an entry point
* Food is what we need 
* Eat is the process
* Exit point  
```
