#Overall Mapping
This page is the last page of this section. From the _[[Employment|[Mapping]-Employment]]_  & _[[Merging|[Mapping]-Merging]]_ concept, here we are going to display the overall mapping by [[diagram|[Mapping]-Overall#by-diagram]] and [[tabulation|[Mapping]-Overall#by-tabulation]].  

_Hopefully you can follow and able to understand to what we have explained. You may check if you have made clear yourself by answering [[questionnaire|[Mapping]-Overall#question-for-you]] on the last of this page._

##By Diagram

Now it is your turn to familiar with the flow on our concept. If you have followed the _[[previous section|[Mapping]-Merging]]_ you can easily figure out the overall result as shown below.
