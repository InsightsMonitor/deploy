#Employment

In this section we will explain about _an employment_ in our concept. The generated symbiotic processes from _[[a spreading|[Mapping]-Spreading]]_ as a further step of factoring _[[a routine|[Mapping]-Routines]]_ by a parameter. 

_Here we do our best to explain as you might get confused. However, in order to get easier on following this section we recommend you to make clear yourself to our [[previous section|[Mapping]-Spreading]]_.
##Basic
Let's put again all of _[[the mappings|Mapping#our-concept]]_ here:

Mapping of the change to your routine process:
```
* Looking for your best food will become an entry point
* An information of best food is what we need 
* Looking is the process
* Exit point  
```
Mapping of the process to collect the library in related with the food:
```
* Food will become an entry point
* Library is what we need 
* Collect is the process
* Exit point  
```
Then we need also the mapping to examine your self to get your data:
```
* You will become an entry point
* Your data is what we need 
* Examine is the process
* Exit point  
```
Let's map about the process of getting the best food for you the same way as your doctor do:
```
* Both of food library and your data will become the entry point
* A best food on library for you is what we need 
* Matching the data is the process
* Exit point  
```

###Assignment
This is the behavior of our mapping when a parameter is put inside the routines. Since there 2 process are generated that the behavior of our mapping will seeking another process to return to its routine. 

We will explain further how these mapping are going to present the process of followings:
  
Mapping of the process to collect the library in related with the food:
```
* Food will become an entry point
* Library is what we need 
* Collect is the process
* Exit point  
```
Then we need also the mapping to examine your self to get your data:
```
* You will become an entry point
* Your data is what we need 
* Examine is the process
* Exit point  
```
###Rules
A process is considered as settled whenever it can be run or return to the entry point and processed normally without any adjustment or modification into the routines.

For instance, let say you have eat the food, then you got that it is not suit to your need. Means it is not the best one for you. So you need to do the searching again at which the process back to the entry point again.   


##1st Employment
Let put again the diagram we have got on _[[previous section|[Mapping]-Spreading]]_  
![hyipworld flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure5.png) 

As you may see, every process will be a different. All is unique.  
![hyipworld flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure6.png)  
So we can now put the mapping schema into a standardization as shown below:  
![Flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure7.png)  

So in line to what he have explained about _[[isogram|Mapping#nonpattern-word-isogram]]_ here you can see the breakdown of the assigned letters as below: 
```js
letter a stand as info  
letter b stand as world  
letter c stand as hyip  
```
###Content Flow
Then the content flow for the 1st Employment can be tabulated as below:
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>flow</th>
      <th>type</th>
      <th>info</th>
      <th>flow</th>
      <th>world</th>
      <th>flow</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td scope="row">:arrow_right:</td>
      <td scope="row">main</td>
      <td scope="row">
        <ul>

      <td scope="row">:arrow_lower_right:</td>
      <td scope="row">
        <ul>
          <li>Bird</li>
          <li>Magic</li>

      </td>
      <td scope="row">:arrow_left:</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td scope="row">:arrow_left:</td>
      <td scope="row">hyip</td>
      <td scope="row">
        <ul>
          <li>Bird</li>
          <li>Magic</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
      <td scope="row">:arrow_lower_left:</td>
      <td scope="row">
        <ul>
          <li>Bird</li>
          <li>Magic</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
      <td scope="row">:arrow_heading_up:</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

##2nd Employment
To became a valuable info then we need to rate the data and became a library. The info it self is got from searching and investigation which in the business is known as monitoring or in a short: monitor.  
```js
letter a stand as monitor  
letter b stand as rating  
letter c stand as hyip  

###Diagram
```
Then diagram will be shown as below:  
![Flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure8.png)
###Content Flow
Then the content flow for the 2nd Employment can be tabulated as below:
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>flow</th>
      <th>type</th>
      <th>monitor</th>
      <th>flow</th>
      <th>rating</th>
      <th>flow</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td scope="row">:arrow_right:</td>
      <td scope="row">main</td>
      <td scope="row">

      </td>
      <td scope="row">:arrow_left:</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

      <td scope="row">hyip</td>
      <td scope="row">

      </td>
      <td scope="row">:arrow_lower_left:</td>
      <td scope="row">

          <li>Bird</li>
          <li>Magic</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
      <td scope="row">:arrow_heading_up:</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>

##3rd Employment
On the 2nd employment, _<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monitoring" target="_blank">Monitoring</a>_ is process to gain the data, _Rating_ is process of sorting the data to become a library. 

###Script
As a symbiotic relationship with the 2nd employment so the 3rd employment is simply produce _a query_ in such a way that it will give _a result_ when it is implemented to the library.  

Here we need a language so that a library will understand what _a query_ is. People call this language as _<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL" target="_blank">SQL</a>_ stand as the abbreviation of _Structured Query Language_.

When we see the explanation of what _SQL_ is, it contain of statement that structured as a code to do a process on a Library. So it is actually a scripting language.

Let's call it from here as _<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/script" target="_blank">a script</a>_ then.
   
So how _a script_ can be produced? How to get it to become able to be implemented?

###Team
In our concept the _Rating_ shall do the same language with the _Script_ on managing the data. So here the _Script_ again has become a symbiotic relationship with the _Rating_.

So now, it is left only what kind of process that become a symbiotic relationship with the _Monitoring_, right?

As we have mentioned above, _Monitoring_ generally means to be aware of the state of a system, to observe a situation for any changes. You can also found in more details about definition of the _Monitoring_ on the <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/monitoring">Wiktionary</a>.

Question is how to carry out this kind of process, no other way we have to built a group of people involved in the same activity to carry them all together.

Let's make a little test in a cross way in related to the symbiotic relation
* The 2nd Employment produce _a library_ - the 3rd Employment produce _a query_
* On 2nd Employment: _Monitoring_ collect entry data - _Rating_ convert to _the library_  
* On 3rd Employment: _Team_ collect data on exit point - _Script_ convert to _the query_ 
* _Script_ is the language of _Rating_ activity - _Monitoring_ is the language of _Team_  activity

Seems everything are correct. So _<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/team" target="_blank">a team</a>_ is supposed to be the one !
###Diagram
```js
letter a stand as script  
letter b stand as team  
letter c stand as hyip  
```
Then diagram will be shown as below:  
![Flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure9.png)
###Content Flow
Then the content flow for the 3rd Employment can be tabulated as below:
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>flow</th>
      <th>type</th>
      <th>script</th>
      <th>flow</th>
      <th>team</th>
      <th>flow</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td scope="row">:arrow_right:</td>
      <td scope="row">main</td>
      <td scope="row">
        <ul>
          <li>Bird</li>
          <li>Magic</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
      <td scope="row">:arrow_lower_right:</td>
      <td scope="row">
        <ul>
          <li>Bird</li>
          <li>Magic</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
      <td scope="row">:arrow_left:</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td scope="row">:arrow_left:</td>
      <td scope="row">hyip</td>
      <td scope="row">
        <ul>
          <li>Bird</li>
          <li>Magic</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
      <td scope="row">:arrow_lower_left:</td>
      <td scope="row">
        <ul>
          <li>Bird</li>
          <li>Magic</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
      <td scope="row">:arrow_heading_up:</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Until this point our section for the employment is completed.
#What's Next
Combining all together we have now 3 kind of Employments which are:  
 
_1. [[Info & World|[Mapping]-Employment#1st-employment]]: info - world_  
_2. [[Monitor & Rating|[Mapping]-Employment#2nd-employment]]: monitor - rating_  
_3. [[Script & Team|[Mapping]-Employment#3rd-employment]]: script - team_  

##The Three

Employment can be all kind of process that you want. In our concept we just need _three (3) of employments_. One for routines, and the other two for the process in related to the parameter.

You may see that each kind of these _three (3) of employments_ has four (4) processes, becoming twelve (12)  processes all together.
##The Last One
We have pronounced since the beginning that all the mappings has always got four (4) parts. 

Either mapping for _[[a routine|[Mapping]-Routines]]_, diagram for _[[a spreading|[Mapping]-Spreading]]_, also for an employment. All of them got always four (4) parts. So why we only take _three (3) of employments_. Not four (4)? 

Actually there is _The Fourth (4th)_. Stand as _The Last Employment_. A very special _Employment_. The key of all this concept. So let's stop the employments until this point. 

We are going to bring you to _[[The Fourth|[Mapping]-Merging]]_.
