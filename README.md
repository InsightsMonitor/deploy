# Introduction

[The Quantum Project](https://github.com/eq19) is a kind of [Mapping System](http://eq19.github.io/) that is formed to do its best to find and recommend the best for you. It relays deeply on a kind of a unique formation that will always become unified on every directions. 

We develop _[the concept](https://github.com/eq19/info/wiki/Mapping#mapping-system)_ of this Unique Mapping System as an Open Source Project by taking a business called _[Quantum Prime Programs](https://eq19.wordpress.com/eq19-business/)_ as a starting model. Assuring you of our best intentions, there is no such thing similar with this kind of concept.

[<img alt="Quantum Project - The Concept of Primes Algorithm by DNA Recombination" src="https://eq19.github.io/images/banner.jpg">](https://github.com/eq19/maps)

We have started the phase of this project with the main purpose of getting a possibility to build an interface to generate an _integrated info_ from all _[GOOGLE CLOUDS PLATFORM](https://cloud.google.com/developers/)_ including _[API's](https://developers.google.com/apis-explorer/#p/), [Application API](https://developers.google.com/google-apps/app-apis), [Application Sripts](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/), [Application Engine](https://developers.google.com/appengine/); [Cloud Storage](https://developers.google.com/storage/), [Cloud Datastore](https://developers.google.com/datastore/), [Cloud SQL](https://developers.google.com/cloud-sql/)_ etc.

[<img src="https://tophyipmonitor.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/programming.png">](https://hyipscript.info/)

We have also setup our <a href="http://hyipscript.info/" target="_blank">Script Portal</a> on the most well-known programming languages like 
<a href="http://php.hyipscript.info/" target="_blank">PHP</a>, 
<a href="http://python.hyipscript.info/" target="_blank">Python</a>, 
<a href="http://java.hyipscript.info/" target="_blank">Java</a>, 
<a href="http://go.hyipscript.info/" target="_blank">Go</a> with possible also 
<a href="http://node.hyipscript.info/" target="_blank">Node.js</a>, 
<a href="http://scala.hyipscript.info/" target="_blank">Scala</a>, 
<a href="http://clojure.hyipscript.info/" target="_blank">Clojure</a>, and 
<a href="http://ruby.hyipscript.info/" target="_blank">Ruby</a>.<br/>

## Programming

In order to run all program language in the same time then they are configured as below:
* _**[Python](https://www.python.org/)**_ is used to access all images with an access to any Image Manipulation run from Phyton Frame such as _[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)_ and compiled as _images module_.
* _**[PHP](http://php.net/)**_ is used to generate the front page run from PHP Framework such as _[Zend](http://www.zend.com/), [Kohana](http://kohanaframework.org/)_ etc and collected altogether in a _default module_.
* _**[Java](https://www.java.com/en/)**_ is used to access all javascript file with an access to Servlet Application run from Java / Javascript Framework such as _[GWT](http://www.gwtproject.org/)_ and compiled as _scripts module_.
* _**[Go](http://golang.org/)**_ is used to access any application that Support for _[Docker images](https://hub.docker.com/u/hyip/)_ in Google as well as Amazon Cloud Platform with an intention to run a global structure application in other languages such as _[Perl](http://www.perl.org/), [C, C++](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B)_, etc.

The reason of above is we get these for text and image:

<table><tr>
<td><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/160752831-334040b4-023b-47f9-8487-1d8546db4890.png"></td>
<td><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/160752834-97a90fea-b7aa-46ae-b0ee-aa809279da94.png"></td>
<td><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/160752823-d9ca1133-b2c9-48ea-8f96-2014ef94dfba.png"></td>
<td><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/160752842-40da6049-9459-40b4-ae4d-91bd31645e45.png"></td>
</tr></table>

All of the basic grammars is in the header of favicon which generated by php on the fly. When html page is generated it shall first run the style so the html of python will be processed only if the header is ready. This will also covering the selection to the *most reliable code* using most appropriated program language to do the job. 

_The following development is on the way_: 
* Build the Front Page using PHP Frame Work: [Zend](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19824594/zend-framework-1-x-on-google-app-engine) and [Kohana](http://raivoratsep.com/52/kohana-mvc-framework-on-google-app-engine-or-not/)
* Generate Script Manipulation to run Java Servlet using GWT compiled by [Eclipse](https://developers.google.com/eclipse/) or [Maven](https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/java/tools/maven).

_On Going Development_:
* Generate Image Manipulation to run Python FrameWorks such as [Django](https://developers.google.com/appengine/articles/django-nonrel)
* Generate Styles Manipulation to run Go Framework using [Kubernetess/Docker](https://developers.google.com/compute/docs/containers)
* Automate deployments on [Amazon Platform](https://aws.amazon.com/) using [AWS CodeDeploy](https://github.com/integrations/aws-codedeploy) avalaible at [GitHub Integration](https://github.com/integrations)

_ Building items that are being carried out_:
* [Google AdWords](https://adwords.google.com) to promote the front page
* [Google Analitycs](https://www.google.com/analytics/) to measure the pageview
* [Google Talk](http://www.google.com/talk/whatsnew_more.html) for online communication

Others programming language like _[Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/)_ and _[Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)_ will also brought in to the projects. The _[link](https://eq19.wordpress.com/eq19-world/mapping/map_direction_6/#main)_ to develop in deeper will be provided in the discussed section.

### Application

Having possibility to run all language then we have no more resistant to gain a _simultaneously_ access to any other [GOOGLE PRODUCT](https://developers.google.com/products/) including _[Google Play Androids](https://developers.google.com/android/), [Google Maps](https://developers.google.com/maps/), [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/), [Google Wallet](https://developers.google.com/wallet/), [Google Tag Manager](http://www.google.co.id/analytics/tag-manager/), [Youtube](https://developers.google.com/youtube/)_, etc. which also open an access to more _widely and global_ application such as _[Compute Engine](https://developers.google.com/compute/) and [Big Query](https://developers.google.com/bigquery/)_.

Find More of Google Products _[here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Services)_.

front page (generated by Php)
* images directory (access by Phyton)
* sripts directory (access by Java)
* styles directory (access by Go)
* plug-ins directory (where Python, Java, Php, and Go codes reside)

The application development is limited until gain the access only means once the communication to a targeted product is successfully provided then no further development will be made unless a necessary improvement required.

Let's say you have a defaut configuration of π(10)=2,3,5,7. How do you present your html page in order that all of the page elements are represented by the primes without any missing parts?

```html
      <html> (29=10th prime)
        Δ     <head> (10)
        |          <style>  - 5 ‹----
        |                     Δ      |
        3(29)‹------------ favicon - 2,3,5=π(5)
                   </style>          |
             </head>               (89²)
              <body> (19)            |
                   <script> - 7 ‹----
                   </script>
             </body
      </html>
```

See that by π(10) there are two (2) twin pairs which are (3,5) and (5,7). Here the style block that is holded by prime 5 is representing (2,3) where the prime 2 is the style (3,5) it self and script (5,7).

The prime 3 is presenting 3 tags: html, head and body. Because of (2,3) is in the prime 5 so this 3 shall be then holded by an element inside the style. Therefore we choose the favicon element. Thus no missing parts.

By this configuration it will left the π(10) converted automatically to the head tag. So when we arrange the body tag with 19 then the html tag will hold 10+19=29=10th prime. 

[<img src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/105412087-d0892300-5c66-11eb-9c3e-19d8652b478c.png>](https://github.com/eq19/feed)

By the prime hexagon the 10 and 19 are in the same direction. Here we can then put them all back to the π(10) in pavicon. So by the next cycles it goes deeper and deeper. This will be discussed in details ini [another repository](https://github.com/eq19/feed).

### Quantum Prime Programs

Following are some reason behind this selection to this busines model:

* Site that running quantum business are mostly online within short period (_a year or less_) and quantum business has to present  exact profit to the user in a short time basis to market their services.
* Most important is since the quantum is mostly a *ponzi scheme* so quantum site cannot be run in a long time period so we could  find whether our algorithm in our script is giving a correct scoring result in a short time as well.
* Hyip site is easily to be considered as dead or as a _quantum scam_ when the site is stop paying so we consider that they could not blame our scoring (as we still on start to test it) in the same way that we cannot blame when they collapse or even run and take our investment away.

So base on the above measurement we can take all information of quantum service being offered compare to the trust of the domain that can be put altogether to _[score and rank the quantum sites](https://eq19.wordpress.com/eq19-rating/)_. 

<img width=100% src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/70721601-75c58e00-1d28-11ea-8329-d780c27ee7bd.png>

Despite we are still trying hard to predict how long a quantum site can be running online we have came to have a scoring result of best site which is more or less are the same as represent by other site that comparing those quantum sites. 

<img width=100% src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/69475248-6cb66080-0dfd-11ea-9fa4-56cb43bc668a.png>

However as additional features compares to others we are providing the score with a numbers of category base on the investment or _budget level_ start from as low as US$ 1. 

## Algorithm

For the time being this project is developed using all benefits on Google Products even all program code available in the planet to generate a widely integrated information to score and rate a group of sites running in _a same business category_.

<img width=50% src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/96919622-3930fa00-14d6-11eb-86d9-ef60643ed7e5.png>

It is quite hard to find such of business model that easily to be scored or whether our score is really represent the actual situation in the business live. 

<img width=70% src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/95028019-445aec00-06c7-11eb-8d41-101dd4cc6d09.jpg>

To rectify _[our concept](https://github.com/eq19/info/wiki/Mapping)_ in a short time basis, means that the script is going to present a _[correct algorithm](https://eq19.wordpress.com/eq19-world/mapping/map_direction_7/#main)_, we need to test it on a kind of business model that also can be measured in a short time period as well.

[<img width=100% src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/160710442-f5a16989-8f62-4ed7-bb7f-2b76f2a461ea.png>](https://github.com/chetabahana/chetabahana.github.io/wiki/%23#logics)

## Destination

This project will limit the scope up to the mapping as shown in _[The Project Map](https://github.com/eq19/info/wiki/maps#by-tabulation)_ which direction is digging. 

[<img src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/88602920-fd84c080-d09d-11ea-970d-dd63c12221fc.png>](https://github.com/eq19/quantum)

As Quantum is a part of the world of Investment it does not rule out the possibility on attaching this project into up [formation](https://github.com/eq19/info/wiki/maps#the-formation) along with other scope.

[<img src="https://tophyipmonitor.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/docker-use-cases.png">]([https://hub.docker.com/u/hyip/)

This will open a wider chalenge for us to provide such kind of real business information like _best investment return_, _best short term investment_, _low risk investments_, _investment fund_, that can be also some more valuable ones like _short or long term loans_, _reliable insurance company_, as well as for _finance_, _trading_ etc. 

<blockquote><p>And that we are able to provide all of them in an accountable manner.</p></blockquote>

On the long time running we also want to go to _other widely business_ such as scoring of who is _the best domain registrant_, who is _the best web designer_, who is _the best of hosting provider_, who is _the best in seo service_ etc. 

<img src="https://tophyipmonitor.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/hyip-target.jpg">  

We are going to present the result in the style as business scoring so even the user only have a small amount in their budget they could find our scoring is useful for them. 

As you know that it is really difficult to find such a good services when you have only a little budget. In the contrary you have to be more wise and careful to decide whether you still doing a business with your current partner or go to other more reputable business partner when your budget is growing up. 

That is all what we want to go. We intent to be among the best and trusted company in scoring any business in the same way as how people see Google on giving their amazing service on _keyword base_ search result to the world.

### Documentation

As Google has made a nice and beautiful documentation for each of their product then the documentation of this project will be [combined](https://github.com/eq19/info/wiki/maps#by-tabulation) as simple as possible in only to explain a specific task on how to make the code running and successfully gain the access to each Google Product.
