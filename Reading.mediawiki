= Reading =
[[Reading|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading]] is a complex cognitive process of decoding symbols in order to construct or derive meaning (reading comprehension). It is a means of language acquisition, of communication, and of sharing information and ideas. 

== Text ==
Like all language, it is a complex interaction between the text and the reader which is shaped by the readerâ€™s prior knowledge, experiences, attitude, and language community which is culturally and socially situated. 

The reading process requires continuous practice, development, and refinement. In addition, reading requires creativity and critical analysis.
=== Writing ===
The process of recording information to be read later is [[writing|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writing]]. In the case of computer and microfiche storage there is the separate step of displaying the written text. For humans, reading is usually faster and easier than writing.
=== Literacy ===
[[Literacy|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literacy]] is the ability to use the symbols of a writing system. It is the ability to interpret what the information symbols represent, and to be able to re-create those same symbols so that others can derive the same meaning. Illiteracy is not having the ability to derive meaning from the symbols used in a writing system.
== Computer ==
[[Reading|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_(computer)]] on computers is to acquire data from a source and place it into their volatile memory for processing. 
=== Memory ===
For example, a computer may read information off a floppy disk and store it in random access memory to be placed on the hard drive to be processed at a future date. 
=== Bits ===
Computers may read information from a variety of sources, such as magnetic storage, the Internet, or audio and video input ports.

A read cycle is the act of reading one unit of information (e.g. a byte). A read channel is an electrical circuit that transforms the physical magnetic flux changes into abstract bits. 
== Divination ==
Divination (from Latin divinare "to foresee, to be inspired by a god", related to divinus, divine) is the attempt to gain insight into a question or situation by way of an occultic, standardized process or ritual. 
=== Forms ===
Used in various forms throughout history, diviners ascertain their interpretations of how a querent should proceed by reading signs, events, or omens, or through alleged contact with a supernatural agency.
=== Insight ===
Divination can be seen as a systematic method with which to organize what appear to be disjointed, random facets of existence such that they provide insight into a problem at hand. If a distinction is to be made between divination and fortune-telling.
== Fortune-telling ==
[[Fortune-telling|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune-telling]] is the practice of predicting information about a person's life.
=== Culture === 
The scope of fortune-telling is in principle identical with the practice of divination. The difference is that divination is the term used for predictions considered part of a religious ritual, invoking deities or spirits, while the term fortune-telling implies a less serious or formal setting, even one of popular culture, where belief in occult workings behind the prediction is less prominent than the concept of suggestion, spiritual or practical advisory or affirmation.
