= Reading =
[[Reading|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading]] is a complex cognitive process of decoding symbols in order to construct or derive meaning (reading comprehension). It is a means of language acquisition, of communication, and of sharing information and ideas. 

== Text ==
Like all language, it is a complex interaction between the text and the reader which is shaped by the readerâ€™s prior knowledge, experiences, attitude, and language community which is culturally and socially situated. 

The reading process requires continuous practice, development, and refinement. In addition, reading requires creativity and critical analysis.
=== Writing ===
The process of recording information to be read later is [[writing|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writing]]. In the case of computer and microfiche storage there is the separate step of displaying the written text. For humans, reading is usually faster and easier than writing.
=== Literacy ===
[[Literacy|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literacy]] is the ability to use the symbols of a writing system. It is the ability to interpret what the information symbols represent, and to be able to re-create those same symbols so that others can derive the same meaning. Illiteracy is not having the ability to derive meaning from the symbols used in a writing system.
== Computer ==
[[Reading|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_(computer)]] on computers is to acquire data from a source and place it into their volatile memory for processing. For example, a computer may read information off a floppy disk and store it in random access memory to be placed on the hard drive to be processed at a future date. 

Computers may read information from a variety of sources, such as magnetic storage, the Internet, or audio and video input ports.
