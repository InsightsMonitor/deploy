#Settlement
Let's clean the mapping that we get on the last result, now we can get it as shown below:  
![Flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure16.png)  
This is the result of the employment of _The Fourth_. The same as other mappings, this result has also four (4) parts, each of them are separated by a line.

##Overall
You may see also that the result is remain consist of _[[the three (3) employments|[Mapping]-Employment#the-three]]_. Each of them has four (4) processes that become twelve (12) all together. You may count also that _this twelve_ is consist of six (6) main & six (6) displaying processes. 

**So where is _The Fourth_?**

You may agree that _The Fourth_ is not even seen anywhere. But in fact _The Fourth_ is _THE ONE_ that making the _[[settlement|Mapping#settlement]]_. Means _The Fourth_ is exist from the beginning till the end. _The Fourth_ is exist everywhere. _The Fourth_ is overall. Without _The Fourth_ all is nothing ! 

Please check the appearance of the overall concept:
