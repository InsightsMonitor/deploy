#Settlement

In this section we will explain in details about _[[settlement|Mapping#settlement]]_ in our concept. The process of handed over from _[[a merging|[Mapping]-Merging]]_ in related to the assigned parameter of _[[a routine|[Mapping]-Routines]]_. 

_Here we do our best to explain as you might get confused. However, in order to get easier on following this section we recommend you to make clear yourself to our [[previous section|[Mapping]-Merging]]._
##Basic
Let's put again all of the mappings here:
###Routine
Mapping of _[[a routine|Mapping#routines]]_
```  
* Hungry will become an entry point
* Food is what we need 
* Eat is the process
* Exit point  
```
###Parameter
Mappings by _[[a parameter|Mapping#parameter]]_  

Mapping of the change to your routine process:
```
* Looking for your best food will become an entry point
* An information of best food is what we need 
* Looking is the process
* Exit point  
```
Mapping of the process to collect the library in related with the food:
```
* Food will become an entry point
* Library is what we need 
* Collect is the process
* Exit point  
```
Then we need also the mapping to examine your self to get your data:
```
* You will become an entry point
* Your data is what we need 
* Examine is the process
* Exit point  
```
Let's map about the process of getting the best food for you the same way as your doctor do:
```
* Both of food library and your data will become the entry point
* A best food on library for you is what we need 
* Matching the data is the process
* Exit point  
```
Let's clean the mapping that we get on the last result, now we can get it as shown below:

This is the result of the employment of _The Fourth_. The same as other mappings, this result has also four (4) parts, each of them are separated by a line.

##Rules
![Flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure16.png)  
Four (4) parts.

###Matching Diagram
![hyipworld flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure5.png)  
Four (4) processes.  

###Settlement Diagram
![hyipworld flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure4.png)  
Four (4) repositories.  

###Routines Diagram
![hyipworld flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure1.png)  
Four (4) elements.  


##Application
Now we are going to bring you to _[[Comparison|[Mapping]-Comparison]]_.
