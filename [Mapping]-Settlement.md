#Settlement

In this section we will explain about the employment in our concept. Please be prepared your self as we are going deeper and deeper. 

_Here we do our best to explain as you might get confused. However, in order to get easier on following this section we recommend you to make clear yourself to our [[previous section|[Mapping]-Merging]]._
##Basic
Let's put again all of _[[the mappings|Mapping#our-concept]]_ here:

Mapping of the change to your routine process:
```
* Looking for your best food will become an entry point
* An information of best food is what we need 
* Looking is the process
* Exit point  
```
Mapping of the process to collect the library in related with the food:
```
* Food will become an entry point
* Library is what we need 
* Collect is the process
* Exit point  
```
Then we need also the mapping to examine your self to get your data:
```
* You will become an entry point
* Your data is what we need 
* Examine is the process
* Exit point  
```
Let's map about the process of getting the best food for you the same way as your doctor do:
```
* Both of food library and your data will become the entry point
* A best food on library for you is what we need 
* Matching the data is the process
* Exit point  
```
Let's clean the mapping that we get on the last result, now we can get it as shown below:  
![Flow](https://hyipworld.github.io/images/github/doc/figure16.png)  
This is the result of the employment of _The Fourth_. The same as other mappings, this result has also four (4) parts, each of them are separated by a line.

##Overall
You may see also that the result is remain consist of _[[the three (3) employments|[Mapping]-Employment#the-three]]_. Each of them has four (4) processes that become twelve (12) all together. You may count also that _this twelve_ is consist of six (6) main & six (6) displaying processes. 

**So where is _The Fourth_?**

You may agree that _The Fourth_ is not even seen anywhere. But in fact _The Fourth_ is _THE ONE_ that making the _[[settlement|Mapping#settlement]]_. Means _The Fourth_ is exist from the beginning till the end. _The Fourth_ is exist everywhere. _The Fourth_ is overall. Without _The Fourth_ all is nothing ! 

Please check the appearance of the overall concept:

Four (4) parts.

Four (4) repositories.

Four (4) elements.  


##Application
Now we are going to bring you _[[Overall Mapping|[Mapping]-Overall]]_.
