== Basic text formatting ==
You can format the page using Wikitext special characters.

You can ''italicize'' text by putting 2 
apostrophes on ''each'' side. 

3 apostrophes will '''bold''' the text.

5 apostrophes will '''''bold and italicize''''' 
the text.

(Using 4 apostrophes doesn't do anything
special -- <br /> 3 of them '''bold''' the text
as usual; the others are ''''just'''' apostrophes
around the text.)

A single newline
generally has no effect on the layout.
These can be used to separate
sentences within a paragraph.
Some editors find that this aids editing
and improves the ''diff'' function
(used internally to compare
different versions of a page).

But an empty line
starts a new paragraph.

When used in a list, a newline ''does'' affect the layout ([[#lists|see below]]).

''Headings'' organize your writing into 
sections. The ''Wiki'' software can automatically 
generate a [[help:Section|table of contents]] from them.

<!-- don't use standard since it will move the edit block -->

<h3>Subsection</h3>
Using more "equals" (=) signs creates a subsection.

<h4>A smaller subsection</h4>

Don't skip levels, like from two to four equals signs.

Start with 2 equals signs not 1 because 1 creates H1 
tags which should be reserved for page title.

[[Leading spaces]] are another way to preserve formatting.

 line stops the text

 characters: &amp;rarr;
</pre>
|}

As you can see in the examples above, all three formatting options
still interpret special characters 
(E.g. <code>&amp;rarr;</code> as &rarr;).
If you want the displayed text to to appear as if this intrepretation
was not happening, replace the ampersand in each of the special characters
with <code>&amp;amp;</code>.  
(E.g. <code>&amp;amp;rarr;</code> will display as &amp;rarr;)

It's not necessary to replace the ampersand when 
it's not part of a special character 
(E.g. <code>Search & Replace</code> will appear as "Search & Replace").
But it's fine to do so.
(<code>Search &amp;amp; Replace</code> will appear as "Search &amp; Replace".)
If you're creating a tool that generates mediawiki text,
where special characters should appear as if they're not interpretted,
it may be simplest to replace ''all'' ampersands with <code>&amp;amp;</code>.

<code>&lt;pre></code> and <code>&lt;nowiki></code>
are both terminated by the first matching end tag found
(<code>&lt;/pre></code> or <code>&lt;/nowiki></code>).
They don't nest;
embedding another
<code>&lt;pre></code> and <code>&lt;nowiki></code>
start tag doesn't mean that next
end tag will be ignored.
If you want to include an end tag in the formatted text, 
one way to create that appearance is to replace the less than character
with <code>&amp;lt;</code>.
(I.e. <code>&amp;lt;/pre></code> or <code>&amp;lt;/nowiki></code>
will be displayed as
&lt;/pre> or &lt;/nowiki>).
If you're creating a tool that generates mediawiki text,
where an end tag might appear in the formatted text,
it may be simplest to replace ''all'' less than characters 
with <code>&amp;lt;</code>.

===Source code===
{{TNT|main|mw:Extension:SyntaxHighlight GeSHi}}
If the syntax highlighting extension is installed, you can display programming language [[w:source code|source code]] in a manner very similar to the HTML <code><nowiki><pre></nowiki></code> tag, except with the type of [[w:syntax highlighting|syntax highlighting]] commonly found in advanced text editing software.

Here's an example of how to display some [[w:C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] source code:

<pre>
<source lang="csharp">
// Hello World in Microsoft C# ("C-Sharp").

using System;

class HelloWorld
{
    public static int Main(String[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
        return 0;
    }
}
</source>
<nowiki></nowiki></pre>

Results in:

<source lang="bash">
// Hello World in Microsoft C# ("C-Sharp").

using System;

class HelloWorld
{
    public static int Main(String[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
        return 0;
    }
}
</source>

==Images, tables, video, and sounds==
<i>This is a very quick introduction. For more information, see:
* [[Help:Images and other uploaded files]], for how to upload files;
* [[w:en:Wikipedia:Extended image syntax]], for how to arrange images on the page;
* [[Help:Table]], for how to create a table.</i>

After uploading, just enter the filename, highlight it and press the "embedded image"-button of the edit_toolbar.

This will produce the syntax for uploading a file '''<nowiki>[[Image:filename.png]]</nowiki>'''

Some templates take ''parameters'', as well, which you separate with the pipe character.
